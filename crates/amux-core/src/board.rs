//! The board: canonical state of all work (RR-0005, RR-0011; Invariants 3, 4,
//! 18, 19).
//!
//! The board is not a visualization layer. It is the system of record for what
//! work exists, who owns it, and where it is in its lifecycle (Invariant 3).
//! Every status change goes through [`apply_transition`] — one function, one
//! code path, audited by construction. No work happens off-board.
//!
//! Three separations this module enforces by shape, each bought by a real
//! incident:
//!
//! - **Task state != execution state** (Invariant 19). Nothing here knows
//!   about sessions, rate limits, or crashes. A rate limit changes execution
//!   state, never board state.
//! - **Done != Verified** (Invariant 7). `Done` is a worker's claim; `Verified`
//!   is the harness's conclusion, reached through gates whose criteria are
//!   [`VerifierKind`]s. A failed verification returns the task to `Doing` —
//!   it revokes the claim, not the work.
//! - **Archive is a FLAG, not a status.** Archiving parks a card without
//!   destroying where it was in its lifecycle; restore brings it back exactly.
//!   (The is:armed incident chain, ethos rule 1, was archived cards silently
//!   dropping out of every surfacing mechanism — a flag the queries must
//!   consciously include is at least greppable; a status overwrite loses the
//!   card's actual state forever.)
//!
//! Gates are first-class entities (Invariant 18): a blocked transition returns
//! [`WhyBlocked`] — gate id, criterion, missing evidence, suggested command —
//! never an opaque "gate failed".
