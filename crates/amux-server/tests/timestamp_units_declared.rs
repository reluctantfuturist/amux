//! Every timestamp-shaped column in the schema declares its unit (AMUX-3952).
//!
//! THIS EXISTED AS A RUNTIME INVARIANT AND ONLY AS ONE. Adding a timestamp
//! column is a two-part change: the migration, and the `TIMESTAMP_COLUMNS`
//! entry that says whether it is seconds or milliseconds. Nothing checked the
//! second part until the server had been built, deployed, and evaluated four
//! times.
//!
//! It worked -- `issues.entered_state_at` shipped undeclared at 22:45 and the
//! invariant filed AMUX-3952 by 22:47. But that path costs a deploy, a detector
//! cycle and a lane's turn to learn something the schema knew at compile time,
//! and the card it files reads like a production fault rather than a missing
//! table entry.
//!
//! Runs the SHIPPED predicate (`undeclared_timestamp_columns`) against a
//! database built FROM THE MIGRATION CHAIN, so a new column is in scope the
//! moment its migration is registered and this cannot drift from the runtime
//! check the way a re-derivation would (AMUX-3814).

/// A column added without its unit fails HERE, before it can reach a board card.
