//! ROUTE_TABLE honesty test (AMUX-2610).
//!
//! `request_log::ROUTE_TABLE` is the hand-maintained routing truth behind
//! `GET /api/debug/routes` and the 404/405 annotations + verdicts in
//! `GET /api/logs/analyze`. axum's Router cannot enumerate its routes, so
//! the table can only stay honest by being WALKED against the real
//! composition (`api::router`), and the walk must be able to fail BOTH
//! directions:
//!
//! - **Claimed but not routed**: an OPTIONS probe at a table path that axum
//!   does not route lands in the SPA catch-all — a nested miss answers 404,
//!   a top-level miss answers the catch-all's 405 whose `Allow` is exactly
//!   `GET(,HEAD)`. Concrete entries assert 405 with `Allow` EQUAL (as a
//!   set, HEAD/OPTIONS aside) to the table's methods, so a bogus path fails
//!   either on status or on the Allow set; the one ambiguous case — a
//!   GET-only entry, whose Allow matches the GET-only catch-all's — is
//!   disambiguated by firing the GET and rejecting the catch-all's
//!   BYTE-EXACT 404 body (`{"error": "not found"}` WITH the space —
//!   hand-written only in static_files.rs; every module body is serde-
//!   serialized without it).
//! - **Routed but not claimed** (an under-listed method): the `Allow` set
//!   equality catches it, and the negative twin — a method the table does
//!   NOT list — is fired and must answer 405. If the router actually
//!   mounts that method, the handler answers something else and the walk
//!   fails, forcing the table to list it.
//!
//! Both directions were demonstrated against deliberately-wrong entries
//! before this landed (a nonexistent path, and a GET-only claim on
//! /api/board which also routes POST); see AMUX-2610.
//!
//! `["*"]` (any()) entries invoke their handler on OPTIONS, so for them the
//! walk asserts the answer is NOT the catch-all's signature (405 with
//! Allow ⊆ {GET, HEAD}, or an HTML 404).
