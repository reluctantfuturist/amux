//! `request_to`: a board create routed onto ANOTHER lane's board (AMUX-4653).
//!
//! `amux board request <lane> <title>` used to post
//! `{status: backlog, reviewer: <lane>}` with no session, so the card landed on
//! the SENDER's board. Dispatch selects by session and the reviewer nudge fires
//! only on review/done, so the named lane was never offered it: 88 such cards
//! were sitting in senders' backlogs on 2026-09-15, ten of them
//! mixpeek-finances' (MF-1160..1167, 1169, 1174), draining back into their own
//! pickup as churn.
//!
//! Its own process, so `AMUX_HOME` can point at a fixture fleet. The lanes this
//! suite routes to are FILES under `sessions/`, because that is what the server
//! reads to decide whether a lane exists, is archived, or is isolated.
//!
//! It covers BOTH surfaces that hand work to a peer, `request_to` and the review
//! handoff (AMUX-4662), because they answer to the same reachability resolver and
//! a second fixture fleet would be a second thing to keep in step.
