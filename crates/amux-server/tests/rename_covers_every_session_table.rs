//! A rename must carry every table keyed by a session name (AMUX-4033).
//!
//! Ethan, 2026-09-02: "I tried to rename a worker and it doesnt work ... make
//! sure renames dont change anything under the hood."
//!
//! The rename cascade carried two hand-maintained arrays of table names. A
//! table added to the schema later did not join them, and nothing anywhere
//! said so: the UPDATE simply never ran, the rows kept the dead name, and the
//! lane lost that data with the rename reporting `ok: true` and a tidy list of
//! completed steps. Measured on the live database while renaming
//! `leadership-coaching`: 12 of 21 session-keyed tables were uncovered,
//! including `token_ledger` (the lane's entire cost history) and
//! `telegram_mappings` (chat routing, so replies would address a name that no
//! longer resolves).
//!
//! A LIST NOBODY IS FORCED TO UPDATE IS THE BUG, not the symptom, which is why
//! this reads the SCHEMA rather than checking the list against itself. Built
//! from `migrations/` via `test_memdb_pub`, the same argument AF-328 made for
//! the issues fixtures: a fixture that mirrors the schema by hand drifts, and
//! the drift is invisible until it costs something.
