//! The dashboard's shipped assets must be INTACT and IN STEP — a guard for two
//! classes the standing checks provably cannot catch.
//!
//! 1. TRUNCATION. On 2026-08-11 a one-liner of the shape
//!    `open(p,'w').write(open(p).read().replace(...))` emptied `sw.js`: the
//!    write handle truncates the file before the argument is evaluated, so the
//!    read returned "" and 6123 bytes became 0 — committed and shipped. The
//!    PostToolUse hook runs `node --check`, which PASSED, because an empty
//!    program is valid JavaScript. A parse check is not a content check, and no
//!    amount of care substitutes for one that can fail (ethos rule 7).
//!
//! 2. VERSION SKEW. CLAUDE.md requires `APP_VER` (app.js) and `CACHE` (sw.js)
//!    to be bumped together — a browser holding the cached script otherwise
//!    never receives the fix. That rule has lived only in prose, so the one
//!    thing every client-side deploy depends on was enforced by memory.
//!
//! These read the SAME files `static_files.rs` embeds at compile time, so a
//! green run is about the bytes that actually ship.

/// A WORKER BRANCH IS ISOLATION, NOT DELIVERY (AF-495).
///
/// From the 2026-09-04 Doron session. His worker was off main with nothing
/// pushed, and Ethan read both facts off the screen while Doron could not:
///
///   Ethan: "First off, your amux worker is in a different branch."
///   Doron: "No, I don't know. I don't know why that is."
///   Ethan (later): "It says it's in a different branch. It says nothing is
///                   pushed yet."
///   Doron: "Still. No, I think I'm on main again."   (he was not)
///
/// The branch popover's verdict for that exact state was a GREEN TICK reading
/// "Isolated on worker branch". True, and it is a reassuring signal over the
/// question that mattered: whether anything on the branch had ever left. The
/// popover has no push data and should not pretend to, so the fix is to stop the
/// green line from reading as "all good" and say what isolation does NOT cover.
///
/// Pinned here because it is a CLAIM the UI makes, and this file already holds
/// context-management copy to the available provider behavior. Prose in a

///
/// AMUX-126 (2026-09-07): three more global banners violated exactly that
/// rule — `#no-apikey-banner`, `#org-banner`, `#org-invite-banner` all still
/// carried `z-index: 200`, inherited from before AF-390 landed and never
/// updated to match. CI caught the symptom (a real `locator.click` timeout on
/// mobile/ios-safari in `terminal-message-navigation.spec.ts`, `#no-apikey-
/// banner` named in the error as the element "intercepting pointer events")
/// but nothing had checked the RULE itself — a comment stating an invariant
/// is not a check that can fail (ethos rule 7). This scans every global
/// banner div for its inline z-index and fails if a new one is ever added (or
/// an old one edited) above the overlay's own 100.
/// The peek toolbar's message filter is a BUTTON, and a `<select>` must not
/// come back into that band (AF-591, AMUX-4242).
///
/// The old control was `<label class="peek-msg-filter" for="peek-msg-kind">`

/// on one input and squeezed up, down, find, worker-menu and close to the right
/// edge. `amux` replaced it in c07923e6 with a funnel button plus a filter
/// panel, keeping the count badge so the number was not dropped.
///
/// This is the half that shipped without a signal. The UI fix is real and there
/// was nothing to catch it regressing: a later edit could reintroduce a select
/// into that band and every test would stay green. The two-fix rule asks for the
/// fix AND the thing that self-announces, and the spec for this change named
