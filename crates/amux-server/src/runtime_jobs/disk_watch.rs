//! Disk watch — report regenerable caches that are growing, and delete nothing.
//!
//! # Why this reports instead of capping
//!
//! DESKT-12 purged 43.4GB of ML caches and DESKT-13 thinned 24 APFS snapshots.
//! Both outcomes were gone within days: `~/.cache` refilled and the snapshots
//! regenerated, because a one-shot purge of a LIVE cache has no durable
//! outcome by construction. The obvious next move was a scheduled cap, and
//! measuring first is what stopped it being built.
//!
//! The measurement, from a completed scan of 310,218 directories: 337 GiB sits
//! in nominally-regenerable paths, but only **17.3 GiB of it is untouched for
//! more than 30 days**. Everything large is hot — the shared cargo target dir
//! and a peer repo's `target/` were both written the same day. So an age-based
//! cap reclaims a rounding error, and a size-based cap aggressive enough to
//! matter deletes build artifacts that ~50 lanes are actively using, turning
//! free disk into fleet-wide cold rebuilds. Neither is a good trade, and the
//! owner picked the third option: report, and leave the judgment with the human
//! (ethos rule 8 — report and recommend, do not sweep).
//!
//! That also keeps this honest as models improve. A threshold that auto-deletes
//! is a policy frozen into code; a report is an observation a better reader can
//! act on differently.
//!
//! # The interval is read from the database, not held in memory
//!
//! `PeriodicTask` is in-memory and dies with the process, and this server
//! re-execs whenever ANY lane commits to the shared checkout — often several
//! times an hour. A weekly in-memory timer would therefore essentially never
//! fire, and would fail *silently*, which is the exact shape ethos.md records
//! under D1: the scan-demotion optimisation lived in memory, so a restart
//! removed it most of the time and nothing said so.
//!
//! So the tick is hourly and cheap, and "has a week passed?" is answered by
//! `reclaim_scans` — durable state that survives every restart. The job is
//! idempotent per scan: one card per scan id, ever, enforced by `source_ref`.
