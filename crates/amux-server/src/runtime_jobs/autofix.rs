//! Autofix — notice, file, hand off. **Not a repair engine.**
//!
//! The name is the owner's, the shape is deliberately smaller than the name:
//! amux does not fix anything here. It NOTICES that something broke, files one
//! board card per distinct fault with the evidence already computed, and lets
//! the existing board drive hand that card to a lane at its next turn
//! boundary. Every step is an existing primitive:
//!
//! | step        | primitive        | who does it            |
//! |-------------|------------------|------------------------|
//! | notice      | this runtime job | the server             |
//! | record      | board card       | the server             |
//! | route       | `board_drive`    | the server             |
//! | **fix**     | the worker       | a model, with a turn   |
//!
//! There is no ninth thing. No queue of its own (the board is the queue), no
//! scheduler of its own (`PeriodicTask`), no delivery path of its own
//! (`board_drive` already claims a `todo` card into `doing` under WIP-1 and
//! steers the lane). The single new artifact is a *detector*, and a detector
//! is not a primitive — it is a read over instruments amux already keeps.
//!
//! # It runs OUTSIDE every worker, on purpose
//!
//! Detection and filing happen in the SERVER process. Nothing in this file
//! touches a pane, a send, a tmux capture or a turn boundary; it reads SQLite
//! and the filesystem and it writes a row. That is the entire point: **the
//! thing that watches for breakage must not share fate with the thing that
//! breaks.** If every lane in the fleet is wedged, rate-limited, crashed or
//! simply idle, the cards still get filed and queue up for whenever a worker
//! comes back. Noticing is infrastructure; fixing is work.
//!
//! The corollary is that this job must never be "smart". It has no model call
//! anywhere — titles are COMPUTED from the signature (ethos rule 2: the
//! 12-15k-token label call is the most wasteful touchpoint this repo has
//! measured, and the throttle it needed is why most commands never reached the
//! board). Everything a model should decide — is this real, is it worth
//! fixing, what is the fix — is left for the lane that picks the card up, with
//! the evidence in hand. That is what compounds when the model gets better.
//!
//! # One filing path, many detectors
//!
//! [`DetectorKind`] enumerates what we watch. Each detector is a pure function
//! over a `&Connection` (plus, for the two that need it, the filesystem)
//! returning `Vec<Finding>` and `Vec<Suppressed>` — so dedupe, card shape,
//! ownership, quiet-detection and the debug surface are written ONCE and
//! cannot drift between detectors. Adding a seventh detector is a new match
//! arm, never a new job.
//!
//! # Dedupe is durable, because a restart must not refile
//!
//! The key is `session_events.idem = "autofix:<signature>"`, protected by the
//! existing `idx_sev_idem` unique partial index — the same mechanism
//! `board_drive` uses for its decompose ask. A signature filed before the
//! process died is still filed after it comes back. The card also carries
//! `issues.source_ref = "autofix:<signature>"`, which is how the quiet sweep
//! finds it again later without a second bookkeeping table.
//!
//! # "Stopped happening" is not "fixed"
//!
//! When a filed signature goes quiet for `AMUX_AUTOFIX_QUIET_H`, the card gets
//! a log line saying so — and nothing else. It is not closed, not archived,
//! not moved. Whether silence means fixed, or means the caller gave up, or
//! means the feature is now unreachable, is a judgment with evidence on both
//! sides, and it belongs to the worker holding the card (ethos rule 8).
//!
//! # Suppression is visible or it did not happen
//!
//! Every decision NOT to file is recorded with its reason and surfaced on
//! `GET /api/debug/autofix`. A detector that silently declines is exactly the
//! failure this whole subsystem exists to end: an absence nobody can see.

/// is not "spanned a restart" and it never was.

///
///   - 0 of 97,019 rows carrying a `boot_at` have `ts < boot_at`. A request
///     cannot arrive before its own process bound the listener, and the startup
///     order makes that structural: migrations run inside `Store::open`,
///     `record_boot` stamps the boot immediately after, and the bind is four
///     hundred lines later. `checks.rs` pins the same relation from the units
///     side.
///   - ALL 4 rows the old expression excluded in 24h were ordinary slow
///     requests that ARRIVED 2.1s, 2.9s, 14.6s and 15.2s after a boot. None of
///     them spanned anything. Two were `GET /api/sessions-git` at ~15s, which
///     is the cache stampede fixed under AMUX-3684. This filter was deleting
///     that defect's own evidence from `slow_outliers` while it was live.
///
/// In a full day the predicate produced false exclusions and nothing else, in
/// the under-reporting direction nobody notices.
///
/// WHY NOT THE `ready_at` COLUMN THE CARD PRESCRIBES: it would be a filter that
/// matches nothing. `ready_at` can only mean the instant the listener binds, and
/// no request can be stamped before that, so `ts < ready_at` is false for the
/// same structural reason `ts < boot_at` is. It would buy a schema change and
/// zero rows. The gap it was meant to measure is logged at startup instead
/// (`ready_after_boot_ms`, lib.rs), so if the assumption ever stops holding the
/// number is already on the record rather than being argued about.
///
/// WHAT REPLACED THE EXCLUSION. Nothing hides these rows now; they are
/// ANNOTATED. `/api/logs/stats` carries `since_boot_s` on every outlier and the
/// outlier finding says how far into its process's life the worst request
/// arrived. A reader sees "2.9s after a restart" instead of being silently
/// protected from the row, which answers AF-186's real concern (a lane
/// investigating an endpoint that was never broken) without discarding evidence.
///
/// A NULL `boot_at` is a legacy row from before the column existed (the newest

/// than being treated as "did not span". Absence is not evidence, and this table

    // endpoint that is probably not the fault, and would bury the board". This
    // detector had no such rollup, so it emitted exactly the cards the other
    // detector's own text argues against. Two detectors on one subsystem
    // disagreeing about whether a correlated slowdown is one fault or many.

    // The specimen is a pair from 2026-08-24: AMUX-3657 (`/api/sessions-git` p95

    // the same window, both true, both unactionable, both discarded. This fan-in

    // the cause turns out to be: a p95 excursion on N families at once is one
    // event, not N tasks.

/// A rate limit is not a per-lane fault and has no per-lane lever. `not-running`,

    // — AND why, since the two reasons have different fixes.
    //
    // It says it once per SKIP SET per hour, naming the paths. It was first
    // written to say it once per RUN rather than once per attempt, because the
    // per-attempt spelling reported the same unchanging path thousands of times
    // and drowned the log it shares with real faults — see the AEAB-45 note
    // below for why that was only half the fix.
    //
    // The known bias is stated in the message itself rather than left for the
    // reader to infer: `du` time scales with directory size, so the paths that
    // blow the budget are disproportionately the LARGEST ones. Measured
    // 2026-08-19 on this machine, the three skipped paths held ~18.5G against
    // 3.7G free while the ranking that DID emerge listed only the also-rans. A
    // report saying merely "incomplete" reads as "here are the big ones plus a
    // few we missed", which is closer to the inverse of the truth.
    // AEAB-45: "once per run" is not a dedupe when the run is on a two-minute
    // timer. The paragraph above was written when this warning moved from
    // once-per-ATTEMPT to once-per-RUN, and the inner loop was the only half
    // that got fixed: the outer one emitted 1,336 identical lines in 24h naming
    // `~/.Trash (du exit 1)`, a condition that CANNOT change — 77% of the whole
    // log, competing with three real findings in the same window. AEAB-13
    // recorded the identical shape at the identical ratio one subsystem over,
    // which is why the mechanism is shared rather than re-spelled here.
    //
    // Keyed on the PATH LIST, not on a bare "disk warned" flag, so a skip set
    // that GROWS is new information and reports at once inside the same hour.
    // Keyed separately per REASON, because a budget timeout and a permission
    // refusal have different fixes and the message says so.

// Detector 8 — CI / deploy (AMUX-2780).
//
// The motivating incident: `deploy-cloud.yml` failed 31 consecutive times over
// three days and NOBODY SAW IT. cloud.amux.io received no deploy at all in that
// window. Every push printed a red X that no instrument in amux read, because
// amux had no instrument that read GitHub at all. The defect is not the SSH key
// that broke — that is one incident. The defect is that CI can fail every night
// and nothing tells anyone.
//
// Two things make this detector different from the other seven, and both are
// worth stating because they change what can go wrong:
//
//  1. **Its instrument is off-machine.** Every other detector reads SQLite or
//     the local filesystem, so "no data" means "nothing happened". Here "no
//     data" can also mean gh is missing, unauthenticated, rate-limited, or the
//     network is down — i.e. the detector is blind, which looks EXACTLY like
//     the all-clear. So every one of those cases emits a `Suppressed` naming
//     the reason. A blind CI detector that reports silence is the precise
//     failure this file exists to end.
//  2. **Failure here is a LEVEL, not an absence.** The ethos warns that
//     picking a threshold is the tell that you are guessing, and it is right:
//     `ci_min_failures()` is a guess. What is NOT a guess is the dedupe key —
//     see the streak anchor below, which is what turns "red every night" into
//     one card instead of thirty.
