//! macOS process health sweep (2026-08-30).
//!
//! Five categories of runaway process cost Ethan a power cycle or a restart
//! and have no other reaper:
//!
//! 1. **Orphaned Ray workers** (`ray::*`). Ray actors that outlive their
//!    cluster — detached actors in particular — pin worker processes forever.
//!    `ray stop` itself does not kill them. If the raylet is gone and these are
//!    still present, they are zombies: no work will ever reach them, but they
//!    hold CPU slots, memory, and file descriptors. Safe to kill when:
//!    the raylet is not running AND the worker has been running for longer than
//!    a short grace period (covers the teardown window).
//!
//! 2. **Orphaned `rustc` debug processes** that outlived their parent cargo run.
//!    Only relevant when a `cargo check` or `cargo test` was interrupted mid-
//!    flight. Detected by: parent PID is 1 (reparented to init = orphan) and
//!    the command line includes the debug target dir.
//!
//! 3. **Orphaned Playwright Chrome roots** using a Playwright temporary
//!    profile whose launcher is gone. Browser-owned profiles are handled by
//!    `browser_reaper`; this covers launcher crashes before ownership exists.
//!
//! 4. **Ghost Claude Code processes** — `claude` processes whose tmux pane no
//!    longer exists. The existing `ghost_rescue.rs` handles the amux-managed
//!    subset; this watches the raw-count ceiling (AMUX_MAC_HEALTH_MAX_CLAUDE)
//!    and logs when it is exceeded so the operator knows before the OOM.
//!
//! 5. **True process-table zombies** (`state=Z`). The child is already dead, so
//!    signalling it cannot clean anything. The sweep calls non-blocking
//!    `waitpid` only for an aged child owned by this amux-server process;
//!    zombies owned by another application are reported and left alone.
//!
//! 6. **SIP-protected indexing daemons pegged hot** (`fseventsd`, `ecosystemd`,
//!    `ecosystemanalyti`, `mds*`). the earlier resident-memory ranking had already
//!    caught `fseventsd` holding 8.8GB in one process, and the 2026-09-11
//!    memory-exhaustion incident (swap 20.7/21.5GB, `fseventsd` 100%+ CPU for
//!    over 11 days uninterrupted) confirmed it cannot be reaped the way
//!    categories 1-5 are: `csrutil status` reports SIP enabled and the binary
//!    itself is flagged `restricted`, so no signal (including from root)
//!    touches it, and no amount of watching changes that. What DOES help is
//!    upstream of the daemon: it is busy because Spotlight is indexing
//!    high-churn directories (`~/Dev`, `~/.amux`, this fleet's scratchpad
//!    tmp), and this machine's separate process-health tool (`procwarden`)
//!    had been logging exactly that recommendation into its own
//!    `~/.procwarden/maintain.log` for a while — "add its churn source to
//!    maintenance.spotlight_exclude" — with nobody ever filling the config in,
//!    because a log line nobody is grepping for is not a fix (ethos rule 6).
//!    Dropping a `.metadata_never_index` sentinel file is the standard
//!    per-directory Spotlight opt-out: it needs no root, cannot lose data, and
//!    is fully reversible (delete the file). It only stops the indexer from
//!    ENTERING new churn from that path — a live backlog already queued still
//!    has to drain, so this is not instant.
//!
//! WHAT THIS WILL NOT DO:
//! - Kill a process whose state it cannot verify. Silence is not dead.
//! - Kill processes the raylet is still using (raylet running = ray is live).
//! - Kill rustc processes whose parent is NOT pid 1 (they may still be running).
//! - Take any action on processes it cannot identify by full command line.
//! - Reap a zombie whose parent is not this exact server process.
//!
//! SAFE: every termination is SIGTERM, not SIGKILL, and every target class has
//! a predicate that cannot be satisfied by a legitimate process doing real work.
