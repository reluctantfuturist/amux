//! "You went idle with N uncommitted change(s)" — ported from Python
//! (AMUX-2638), with the one change that stops a known incident recurring.
//!
//! # The requirement, which is the whole reason this is a card
//!
//! Python derived "yours" from DIRTY-TREE MEMBERSHIP. Measured 2026-08-09: it
//! listed 11 files as mine to commit; I had touched NONE of them — they were a
//! peer's in-flight rust migration — while the staged-guard, asked the same
//! question at the same moment about the same files, answered foreign=4,
//! unclaimed=18, MINE=0. Two components, one question, opposite answers, and
//! the WRONG one was the one giving instructions. Followed literally it sweeps
//! a peer's work into your commit, which happened three times in one day
//! (762e06e, 325314d, 4bf767c).
//!
//! So ownership here comes from [`Ownership`], which is the staged-guard's
//! answer (`POST /api/git/staged-guard`, api/git_guard.rs) and nothing else.
//! `git status` supplies the LIST of dirty paths and no opinion about whose
//! they are. That split is enforced by the signature: [`build`] cannot see a
//! repo, so it cannot re-derive ownership even by accident.
//!
//! # Why a foreign file does not merely get filtered out
//!
//! It is named, loudly, with its owner. The recipient is about to run
//! `git add -A`; the useful thing is not silence about the peer's file, it is
//! "do not commit this one, it is theirs". Python learned that the hard way —
//! the branch was missing entirely and two sweeps (~93 and ~85 lines) followed.
//!
//! # Why `shared` is warned about rather than suppressed
//!
//! On a repo where two lanes routinely touch one file, "both edited it" is
//! satisfied almost always, so suppressing on `shared` would silence the nudge
//! permanently. Name the file as contested and say who else is in it; the
//! recipient can then stage per-hunk instead of per-file.

                 `git checkout origin/main -- <path>` is equally wrong: it restores an artifact \

             edit. The exit status is the conflict COUNT: 0 means git merged it cleanly and you \
             can move /tmp/merged into place; non-zero means real judgment is needed and the \
             markers show exactly where. Handing it to the owner stays the right answer when the \

             two generator outputs is syntactically valid, matches NEITHER source model, was \
             produced by no code, and is silently overwritten by the next regen — so it is \
             wrong and invisible at once. `git checkout origin/main -- <path>` is equally \
             wrong: it restores a spec that does not match the models now in the tree, and the \
             next commit regenerates the divergence. The only correct remedy for that class is \
             REGENERATE FROM SOURCE once the underlying change lands, which belongs to the \
             source owner rather than to whoever this nudge happened to wake.\n\
             HOW TO TELL, and this arm now does where the repo says so: a `linguist-generated` \
             attribute in `.gitattributes` moves a path out of this list and into DIVERGED \
             (GENERATED) above, with the regenerate remedy instead of the recipe. The repo's \

             hook's INPUT TRIGGER, not what it writes (mixpeek's generate-openapi names \
             openapi.json only in free-text `description`). Reported by mixpeek-frustrations \
             and backend, who hit this independently in one night on server/openapi.json and \

             PRINTS A COMMIT -> a genuine old copy. RESTORE it (`git checkout origin/main -- \
             <path>`); do NOT commit it, because `git add -A` or `git commit -a` carries the \
             older copy forward and SILENTLY REVERTS origin — no conflict, the older file just \
             wins (AMUX-3000).\n\
             ANYTHING ELSE -> DO NOT RESTORE; COMMIT the path instead. An empty result means \
             this content is in no commit on any ref: a novel mid-edit a restore DELETES \
             irreversibly (AMUX-3172/AMUX-3188; social-media caught 16 such paths whose \
             worktree matched NEITHER local HEAD nor origin). An error, a timeout, or a result \
             you cannot read is also DO-NOT-RESTORE, because a declined restore is recoverable \
             and a deleted keystroke is not.\n\
             The rest of this is why the obvious shortcut does not work. Behind-on-history does \
             not prove the \
             worktree is a pure old copy: a path can be behind origin AND carry NOVEL \
             uncommitted content, which is exactly the four-of-four case above. Do NOT substitute `git cat-file -e $(git hash-object <path>)`: `git add` (and \
             `git hash-object -w`) writes the blob into the object DB WITHOUT committing, so it \
             answers yes for a never-committed mid-edit and cannot separate a committed old copy \
             from novel work. It is strictly weaker than was-this-committed and its remedy here is \
             a delete (cold-outbound, 2026-08-17: server-fast-checks.yml was mid-keystroke and in \
             no commit on any ref, yet that recipe answered yes; restoring would have deleted it)."

             commit on origin\'s tip, same content, different sha, so it returns as \"a commit \
             your HEAD lacks\". Measured 40.6% false flags on the mixpeek checkout, 737 of 1815 \
             (AF-471). ONLY IF THE BLOBS DIFFER: \
             `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main -- <path>`: prints a commit = origin has work \
             you lack = STALE, so do not commit; restore with `git checkout origin/main -- <path>` \

             `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD -- <path>` prints NOTHING — if BOTH directions \
             print commits the path has DIVERGED (novel and stale at once) and either single-arm \
             remedy destroys one side's landed work: MERGE the versions or hand the path to its \

             prints NOTHING = origin has nothing you lack, so it is current content, and if it \

             YES for a never-committed mid-edit, because `git add` writes the blob into the \
             object DB without committing — and THIS arm is where that matters most, since \
             ownership being unknown is exactly the state a peer's uncommitted work is in \

         A DIFFERENCE FROM origin/main IS NOT A DIRECTION (AMUX-3000). Each of these differs \
         from origin/main, but the guard does not know which side is NEWER — and on this \
         graft-push checkout the worktree is frequently the OLDER side. A stale worktree copy \
         is a LOADED REVERT: `git add -A` carries the older version forward and silently undoes \
         the newer one on origin (no conflict, the older file just wins). So BEFORE staging, \
         PROVE the direction per path with the ANCESTRY test. Do NOT read the line-count of a \
         `git diff` as the verdict: worktree-has-more/has-less misclassifies about 2 in 10 \
         (studio-plg measured it on this checkout: files with MORE lines than origin that are \
         nonetheless stale, because origin has since moved to a shorter version). Roughly 1 in 4 \
         differing paths here are novel mid-edit a blind `checkout` would DESTROY irreversibly, \
         so the direction test is the headline, not a caveat:\n\
         \u{2022} FIRST compare the BLOBS, which is what the classifier does and what the \
         commit graph cannot tell you: `git rev-parse HEAD:<path> origin/main:<path>`. If the \
         two sha1s are EQUAL, origin holds the same bytes your HEAD does and there is nothing \
         of origin's to revert, whatever the commit graph says. Skip to the ordinary commit. \
         GRAFTING is why this comes first: a graft-push builds a NEW commit onto origin\'s tip, \
         so your own landed work returns as a commit your HEAD lacks under a different sha with \
         identical content. Measured on the mixpeek checkout 2026-09-04 (behind 1681, ahead \
         767) by mixpeek-general, reproduced by amux-frustrations and sampled again by \
         mixpeek-cicd: of 1815 paths the commit test flags, 1080 actually differ. 737 false \
         flags, 40.6%. `--find-object` below survives grafting for the same reason this does — \
         it asks about CONTENT reachability, and grafting changes commit identity while \
         preserving content (AF-471).\n\
         \u{2022} ONLY IF THE BLOBS DIFFER does the commit graph mean anything: \
         `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main -- <path>`: if it prints ANY commit, \
         origin has work on this path that your HEAD lacks, so the worktree copy is genuinely \
         older (STALE); do not commit. Restore with `git checkout origin/main -- <path>` ONLY \
         after BOTH: `git log --all --find-object=$(git hash-object <path>) -- <path>` prints a \
         commit (empty or errored means the stale copy carries novel mid-edit a restore would \
         DELETE, so commit the path instead), AND the REVERSE test \
         `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD -- <path>` prints NOTHING.\n\
         \u{2022} if BOTH directions print commits, the path has DIVERGED — novel AND stale at \
         once — and commit and restore each destroy one side's landed work while every test \
         above passes as prescribed. Neither single-arm remedy is safe; three-way merge it, \
         non-destructively (AMUX-3718 — this line used to stop at 'MERGE the two versions' with \
         no procedure): `B=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main); git show $B:<path> >/tmp/base; \
         git show origin/main:<path> >/tmp/theirs; git merge-file -p <path> /tmp/base \
         /tmp/theirs >/tmp/merged; echo conflicts=$?` — `-p` leaves <path> untouched (an \
         in-place merge is a whole-file write over a peer's live edit) and the exit status is \
         the conflict COUNT, so you know whether it is yours to resolve before you hand it to \
         the owner. Live specimen 2026-08-20: mixpeek \
         .githooks/pre-push, origin carrying 96ea161803 and HEAD carrying the MG-1483 guard \
         chain — the one-direction protocol read it STALE and the prescribed restore silently \
         disarmed a data-loss push guard.\n\
         \u{2022} if it prints NOTHING, origin has nothing you lack: the content is yours to \
         keep, `checkout` would DESTROY it, and the safe action is COMMIT, not restore.\n\
         This is the same predicate the guard itself classifies with, so its verdict and your \
         check cannot disagree. Do NOT substitute \
         `git cat-file -e $(git hash-object <path>)`: blob existence cannot tell an OLD revision \
         from a CURRENT one that is merely unpushed, because both were committed at some point \
         and both answer yes. On a checkout that sits ahead of origin every committed file \
         answers yes, so that test reports STALE for the entire tree and its remedy reverts it \
         (AMUX-3000 follow-up, measured 2026-08-16: five committed-but-unpushed paths, five \
         false STALEs, one of them a whole feature shipped that day).\n\
         When the check is ambiguous or you cannot run it, commit — a redundant commit is \
         recoverable and a restore is not. (A `git diff` still shows WHAT changed; just never \
         read worktree-has-more as newer.)\n\
         Commit only the paths whose ancestry test prints nothing, with a clear message; \
         WIP-commit anything intentionally incomplete and say so. Don't leave the working tree \
         dirty — but don't commit a revert to clear it, either."

/// Drop tracked paths whose CONTENT already matches `origin/main`.

/// paths in one ownership warning were BYTE-IDENTICAL to origin. They were not
/// edits at all.
///
/// The cause is a workflow, not a bug in git: several lanes land work with
/// scripts/graft-push.sh, which pushes a tree built from origin WITHOUT moving
/// the local branch. Local HEAD therefore sits permanently behind origin, and
/// every file anyone has successfully landed reads as modified forever after.
/// `git status` is answering "how does the worktree differ from local HEAD",
/// while the warning asks "what might a peer be mid-edit on" — an instrument
/// answering a question adjacent to the one asked.
///
/// It cost a real decision: a session read this signal on tenant_canary.py,
/// concluded a peer was mid-edit, and declined a three-line fix. The file was
/// identical to origin. And a warning wrong 6 times in 7 gets skimmed, so the
/// ONE real entry — an untracked draft that `git add -A` would genuinely have
/// swept up — arrived already discounted.
///
/// UNTRACKED IS NOT A SYNONYM FOR ABSENT-FROM-ORIGIN, and an earlier version of
/// this comment said it was. Reported by creative-dna and reproduced: a file
/// ADDED on origin after local HEAD reads `??` from `git status`, because the
/// local index predates the commit that added it. Untracked is the same
/// artifact for adds that dirty-status is for edits. So the test is PRESENCE ON
/// ORIGIN, never the porcelain letter — a `??` path that matches origin is a
/// phantom and is dropped, while a `??` path genuinely absent from origin is

        //   1. NOT because git's exit status is unreliable — it is. That was

        //      git's (creative-dna measured it, then re-measured with

        //      hinting that a core git command lies is a hazard note someone
        //      would act on, and it would be wrong.

        //      unvalidated strings has an inverse failure
        //      the conservative `_ => false` arm does NOT cover: if both sides

        //      real uncommitted file silently removed from the warning. Keeping

/// restores the directory. Only a per-file list makes the prescribed check
/// runnable at all.
///
/// `normal` is kept for the listing itself. `all` would walk every untracked
/// tree in the repo on every run to answer a question about the few that are
/// dirty; expanding only the directories actually reported pays for what is
/// used. `--exclude-standard` keeps the expansion to exactly what `git status`

            // own message text; reported, not decided here (ethos rule 8). The
            // STALE section's warning is pinned by
            // `stale_section_prescribes_find_object_never_blob_existence`, so

            // EVERY occurrence, not merely one somewhere in the arm (amux,
            // 2026-08-28). The `contains` checks above pin "this arm mentions
            // the guard at least once". The advice is emitted from SIX
            // production strings, so mutating one back to blob-existence left
            // a sibling occurrence satisfying them and 41 tests stayed green.
            //
            // Counting guards against restore prescriptions does NOT work and
            // was measured before being rejected: the restore command also
            // appears in prose and in do-not warnings, so today's CORRECT code
            // reads 3 prescriptions to 1 guard (commit-worthy), 4 to 1
            // (diverged), 5 to 2 (stale), 4 to 2 (revived). That invariant is
            // false on code that is right.
            //
            // This is the rule the section actually follows, and it holds with
            // zero slack in all four arms: blob existence may appear ONLY
            // inside a do-not warning. An occurrence outside one is a
            // prescription, and a correct guard sitting paragraphs away does
            // not reach a reader acting on the line in front of them, which is
            // this test's own rationale applied within an arm instead of
            // across arms.
            // Matched by PROXIMITY, not by one exact phrasing. The first
            // version keyed on "Do NOT substitute `git cat-file -e" and the
            // unknown-ownership arm says "Do NOT use" — correct text, flagged
            // as a live prescription. A matcher pinned to one wording reports
            // the arms that phrase it differently, which is the same
            // wrong-layer error this test exists to catch, pointed at prose.
