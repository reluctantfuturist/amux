//! Release a browser that has had nothing open for a while (AMUX-3829).
//!
//! Ethan, 2026-08-28: "multiple browsers shouldnt be an issue, but it should
//! clean up automatically after idle use." The prompting incident was a browser
//! held 18.1 HOURS with ZERO tabs, blocking him, because nothing in amux reaped
//! one — `runtime_jobs::registry` had no browser job at all.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS SAFE TO DO AUTOMATICALLY, which is not obvious in a subsystem
//! whose comments record three separate incidents of destroying people's staged
//! logins (AMUX-3063, AMUX-3414, AMUX-3610). A COMPLETED login lives on disk in
//! `playwright-auth/profiles/<name>/` and survives a stop: `stop_profile_as`
//! sends SIGTERM precisely so storage flushes, and the only `remove_dir_all` on
//! a profile is the explicit delete verb. So the question is never "will this
//! lose an account" — it is "will this lose an OPEN PAGE", and this job only
//! ever runs when there are none.
//!
//! IDLE IS CONTINUOUS EMPTINESS, NOT AGE. Reaping on "started N ago" would kill
//! a browser someone used a minute ago, and reaping the instant the last tab
//! closes would kill one they are about to reuse. So a profile has to be seen
//! empty on every check across the whole window; one real page anywhere in it
//! resets the clock. That also makes the signal honest under the multi-slot
//! registry (AMUX-3828): emptiness is per profile, so one worker's idle browser
//! is reaped without touching the neighbour a second worker is driving.
//!
//! WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. A browser whose CDP does not answer is NOT reaped.
//! Silence is not zero — the same distinction the takeover refusal draws — and
//! killing a browser because it failed to answer a poll would turn a transient
//! wedge into a destroyed session.
