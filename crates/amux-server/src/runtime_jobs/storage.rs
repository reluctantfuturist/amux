//! Storage retention — the sweep that keeps append-only tables and cache
//! directories from being creep by construction.
//!
//! Filed after the 2026-08-10 disk-full incident: the machine reached 741MB
//! free on a 1.8TB volume with a 50-session fleet running, and transcript
//! writes started failing with ENOSPC. Most of that was build trees outside
//! amux, but the audit that followed found that **amux's own durable state has
//! almost no retention anywhere**: seven append-only tables with no pruning at
//! all, and the server's own tracing log growing for the lifetime of the
//! process. None of it was a leak. All of it was working exactly as written,
//! forever.
//!
//! # Why one job instead of pruning at each write site
//!
//! `_amux_request_log` already prunes itself, and it does it well — but it
//! does it by counting rows inside its own writer task (`SWEEP_EVERY = 1000`).
//! That works because the request log is written constantly. Applied to the
//! other tables it fails in the direction nobody notices: `media-cache` and
//! `uploads` both have correct prune logic that only runs when a NEW job
//! starts, so a fleet that stops transcoding never prunes its transcodes. A
//! cache that only evicts while it is growing is a cache that only evicts when
//! you do not need it to.
//!
//! So retention here is driven by a `PeriodicTask` — time, not traffic. The
//! tick is slow (an hour by default) because nothing here is urgent and a
//! sweeper that runs hot competes with the traffic it is measuring.
//!
//! # The timestamp units are NOT uniform, and that is the dangerous part
//!
//! This is the reason this file is a table of specs rather than a loop over
//! table names. The seven tables carry four different time representations:
//!
//! | table                  | column       | unit                        |
//! |------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
//! | `interaction_log`      | `ts`         | **milliseconds** (INTEGER)  |
//! | `cmd_history`          | `ts`         | **milliseconds** (INTEGER)  |
//! | `session_events`       | `ts`         | seconds (REAL)              |
//! | `token_ledger`         | `ts`         | seconds (INTEGER)           |
//! | `schedule_runs`        | `ran_at`     | seconds (INTEGER)           |
//! | `schedule_audit`       | `ts`         | seconds (INTEGER)           |
//! | `_amux_state_events`   | `at`         | **ISO-8601 TEXT**           |
//!
//! `ethos.md` records that two sessions in one evening wrote
//! `datetime(ts,'unixepoch')` against `interaction_log` and got a cutoff ~1000x
//! too small, so the filter matched the entire table — and one of them nearly
//! reported the whole historical backlog as post-fix regressions. That was a
//! READ. This file does DELETEs.
//!
//! # Both directions are wrong, and they fail in OPPOSITE ways
//!
//! Writing the guard is what surfaced this; the first version of it defended
//! the wrong direction, and the test caught that rather than the code. For
//! `DELETE WHERE ts < cutoff`:
//!
//! - **A seconds table declared `Millis`** builds a cutoff ~1000x too LARGE, so
//!   every row is "older" than it: it **deletes the entire table**. Loud,
//!   catastrophic, unrecoverable.
//! - **A millisecond table declared `Secs`** builds a cutoff ~1000x too SMALL,
//!   so no row is ever older than it: it **deletes nothing, forever**. Silent,
//!   harmless to the data, and it means the bound you think you have does not
//!   exist — which is exactly how this incident happened in the first place.
//!
//! So there are two guards, and they are not symmetric because the failures are
//! not symmetric.
//!
//! # Guard 1 (refusal): a sweep must prove it EXCLUDED something
//!
//! [`sweep_one`] never issues a `DELETE` it has not first bounded. It counts
//! the rows that would REMAIN, and if a non-empty table would be left with zero
//! rows it refuses and logs an error. A sweep that removes 100% of a table is
//! not retention, it is a unit bug — and ethos rule 7's point is that an
//! unbounded match and a correct match look identical from the rows alone.
//!
//! # Guard 2 (warning): a sweep that never fires is not a bound
//!
//! If a sweep deletes nothing from a table it should have reached, the cutoff
//! is not landing where it should. That is not dangerous, so it warns rather
//! than refuses — but it is the failure mode that leaves a table growing behind
//! a knob everyone believes is bounding it.
//!
//! # What guard 1 costs, stated plainly
//!
//! A table whose rows are ALL older than its retention — a subsystem that
//! stopped being written months ago — is indistinguishable from a unit bug from
//! the rows alone, so guard 1 refuses it too and that table does not shrink.
//! That is the deliberate side to be wrong on: a dormant table is by definition
//! not growing, the refusal is logged with the table name and the cutoff, and a
//! human can lower the knob on purpose. The inverse default (delete when
//! unsure) buys nothing and can empty a live table.
//!
//! # Every eviction is logged, or it did not happen
//!
//! A silent eviction destroys the evidence somebody needed. Every delete and
//! every file removal here emits a `tracing::info!` with the count and the
//! knob that authorised it, and the last sweep is held for
//! `GET /api/debug/storage`.
