//! `[ghost-rescue]` — the sweep that finds an amux message sitting UNSUBMITTED
//! in a lane's Claude Code input box and presses Enter for it (py:9153-9178).
//!
//! # This is a FALLBACK, and it has an exit condition
//!
//! A rescue is not a routine event. It is EVIDENCE THAT THE SEND PATH FAILED:
//! amux typed a message into a TUI and the Enter did not register, so the
//! message would have sat there forever. Every rescue is therefore logged at
//! WARN with the session and the text, and emits a `message.rescued` session
//! event — if this job is firing regularly, the bug to fix is upstream in
//! `send_text_inner`, not here.
//!
//! **EXIT CONDITION: delete this module when interactive lanes are driven
//! through `AgentProtocol` instead of keystrokes.** Submission over the
//! protocol is an ACK, not an inference, so there is no state in which text
//! can be "typed but not submitted" and nothing to sweep for. This job only
//! ever runs against lanes for which `lane_has_protocol_path` is false; on the
//! day that returns true for the fleet, the sweep will select nothing and can
//! be removed outright. It exists because the keystroke path is the ONLY path
//! today (measured 2026-08-09: `_amux_sessions` held 0 live rows, so 100% of
//! delivery is keystrokes), not because keystroke delivery is acceptable.
//!
//! # The guards, ported exactly — none of them are optional
//!
//! 1. **Never submit something a HUMAN is composing.** Python's discriminator
//!    is the only one that is actually sound, so it is the only one ported:
//!    every message amux's dashboard sends carries a client-side `[H:MM AM]`
//!    prefix, so pending input that STARTS with one is provably ours and can
//!    never be a person mid-sentence at a real terminal. Anything else is left
//!    alone — including amux's own agent-to-agent messages, which is a real
//!    coverage gap and the correct trade: a false rescue submits a human's
//!    half-written thought.
//! 2. **Never fight a picker, a modal, or a live turn.** The lane must read
//!    `idle`; a selector or a spinner means the Enter belongs to something
//!    else, and an Escape/Enter into a live turn interrupts it.
//! 3. **Never race a send.** The per-session send lock is held across the
//!    re-check and the keys, so a rescue cannot fire an Enter into a pane that
//!    `send_text_inner` is halfway through typing into.
//! 4. **Never resubmit the same text twice.** A rescue is recorded by
//!    (session, text) and suppressed for `RESCUE_COOLDOWN` afterwards, so a
//!    lane whose Enter is being eaten repeatedly produces one rescue and one
//!    warning, not a submit storm.
//!
//! Guard 2's re-check is deliberately a SECOND capture taken under the lock,
//! matching python: the first capture is what selected the lane, and acting on
//! a single torn frame is what once sent Escape into a just-started turn.
