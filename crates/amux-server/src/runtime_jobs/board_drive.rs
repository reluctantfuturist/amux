//! `[board-drive]` — the board→worker drive loop (AMUX-2637).
//!
//! # The outage this restores
//!
//! Python owned the entire loop that turns a board into work: `_pickup_next_
//! board_task` (py:14418), `_advance_open_card` (py:13325) and the level sweep
//! that drives both (`_pickup_level_sweep`, py:14305). The cutover carried the
//! board API across and left the loop behind, and the Rust orchestrator only
//! ever dispatches to RUST-managed workers (`pickup_unowned=false`; a
//! python-owned card carries a `foreign_worker_id` and is never assigned). Every
//! fleet session is python-owned, so since the cutover: no assignments, no
//! advance nudges. Cards sat in `todo`, workers sat idle, and NOTHING errored.
//!
//! Pure absence is the failure mode this module is shaped against. Every tick
//! writes a trace (`/api/debug/board-drive`) naming, per lane, what it did and
//! **why it declined** — because a skip that leaves no trace is
//! indistinguishable from a loop that is not running, which is exactly the state
//! the fleet was in for hours (ethos rule 4; Python learned the same thing at
//! py:14208, `_pickup_skip`, after Ethan had to read source to answer "why is
//! this idle lane sitting on 4 todos?").
//!
//! # LEVEL-triggered, never edge-triggered
//!
//! Python fired pickup from `status == "idle" and prev in ("active","waiting")`
//! — an EDGE — and then had to add `_pickup_level_sweep` because the edge is
//! fragile in exactly this process: it re-execs on every deploy, which clears
//! the previous-status map, so an already-idle lane waits for a transition that
//! may never come (primis: IDLE 142 minutes on 3 pickable todos, py:14308).
//! Only the LEVEL sweep is ported. There is no edge to keep in step with it, so
//! the asymmetry that let one half of the edge (advance) go unbackstopped for
//! months (py:14326) cannot recur here.
//!
//! # Delivery is the steering queue, not a second send path
//!
//! Nothing here types into a pane. A nudge or an assignment is
//! `steer_enqueue`'d and the EXISTING delivery loop
//! (`session_verbs::steer_deliver_tick`) applies the turn-boundary gate
//! (`steer_lane_at_boundary`) and the send choreography. Two consequences, both
//! deliberate:
//!
//! 1. A nudge can never land mid-turn. Interrupting a working model to tell it
//!    something it could have read at its next boundary is the interruption the
//!    ethos warns about, and it was a live bug in the steering path four days
//!    ago ("i sent as a queue but it looks like it was sent directly even though
//!    this worker was still working").
//! 2. Delivery is DURABLE. Python called `send_text(...)` and stamped its
//!    cooldown on the return value; a failed send meant the lane got nothing.
//!    Here the row survives a restart and is delivered at the lane's next
//!    boundary.
//!
//! # What is durable, and why that is not a detail
//!
//! Python held the per-session advance cooldown and the per-lane sweep stamp in
//! process memory, on a server that re-execs many times a day — its own comment
//! (py:14627) calls an in-memory cooldown "fiction" after one was wiped by the
//! first reload and re-fired at the same lane within minutes. Every cooldown
//! here reads `session_events`:
//!
//! | bound                     | key                                    |
//! |---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | re-claim (24h, per card)  | `task.claimed`                         |
//! | advance (15m, per lane)   | `advance.nudged` / `needsyou.renag` / `capture.decompose_ask` |
//! | advance budget (3/24h)    | `advance.nudged` per card id           |
//! | decompose (6h, per lane)  | `pickup.decompose_nudge`               |
//! | claim reconcile (5m→1h)   | `task.claim_reconcile_requested` per exact card set |
//! | needs:you re-nag (3d)     | `needsyou.renag` per card id           |
//!
//! `advance.nudged` additionally records the card's STATUS at nudge time, which
//! Python kept only in memory (`_advance_last_card`, py:12960). That is what
//! makes "did this lane make progress since we spoke?" survive a restart, so a
//! lane that moved the card it was nudged about gets the next one immediately
//! instead of waiting out a cooldown it already earned its way past.

         and move to `verified` only when EVERY criterion there holds, with evidence of \
         what you checked. The gate resolves card -> worker -> group -> global -> type \
         default, so it varies by card; this nudge deliberately does not restate it \
         (AMUX-3477: a previous version hardcoded four criteria the board does not use, \
         and following the instruction literally moved cards on the wrong basis — the \
         AF-112 family, one layer up). If you cannot satisfy the resolved gate honestly, \
         leave the card in `done`. If the work is stale or was superseded, archive it \
         with a note explaining why.\n\n\
         To see ALL of them (this list is the 8 most recent): \
         GET /api/board?status=done&done_limit=0 scoped to you. NOTE: the UNSCOPED \
         /api/board caps terminal (done/verified/discarded) cards at 100, so a done card \
         of yours can look ABSENT there while it is very much on the board — check by id \
         (GET /api/board/<id>) or with the scoped query above, not the capped default \
         (this is the exact trap that read as 'these cards do not exist', 2026-08-13).\n\n\
         Cards that genuinely cannot be verified by you (e.g., they require a human \
         decision or access you lack) should be tagged `needs:you` — with the ask and \
         what unblocks it — to mark them human-blocked. Be honest about what that does \
         today: it moves the card into the dashboard needs:you view, and NOTHING pushes \
         it to the owner (there is no digest/alert/email path for needs:you as of \
         2026-09-03, AC-413). So tag it only when a human genuinely owes the next step; \
         it is not an escape hatch that makes the card someone else's problem."

/// The SHAPE of the fleet's open work, beside the loop that consumes it

///
/// Ethan, 2026-08-26: "we need to rethink how we do amux because this isn't
/// working." Chasing that per-lane finds a different local cause every time —
/// wip-cap here, needsyou-renag-deduped there, dep-other-lane somewhere else —
/// and each one reads like a small bug. The fleet number is the argument the
/// per-lane traces cannot make: measured that day, of 1039 open cards, 48.2%
/// were `backlog` (parked awaiting a trigger), 37.2% were `needsyou` (blocked
/// on a human, median 7.2 days old, max 19.7), and **4.9% were `todo`** — the
/// only status `DISPATCHABLE_WHERE` selects. 51 workable cards across 52 lanes.
///
/// So a lane going idle on a full board is mostly not a defect in this loop.
/// The board is 95% invisible to it BY DESIGN, and the queue that actually
/// feeds it is nearly empty. Nothing in amux said so, because every view is
/// per-lane and the answer only exists in aggregate.
///
/// Deliberately a MEASUREMENT and not an action: promoting backlog or resolving
/// needsyou on the fleet's behalf would be an agent deciding a human's work is
/// unblocked (ethos rule 8). This reports; a human decides.
///
/// `dispatchable_pct` is the headline. It reads ZERO in two very different
/// worlds — a fleet with nothing to do, and a fleet whose whole board is parked
/// — so `open_total` rides along in the same payload to tell them apart.
