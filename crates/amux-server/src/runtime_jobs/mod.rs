//! Runtime jobs (Phase 3, RR-0058..RR-0062): two DELIBERATELY separate kinds
//! of "run something later".
//!
//! # DurableSchedule vs PeriodicTask — why two types
//!
//! The plan is explicit ("these are different things with different
//! semantics") and the separation is type-level on purpose:
//!
//! - [`scheduler::DurableSchedule`] is USER data. It is DB-backed (the live
//!   `schedules` table the Python server also reads/writes), survives
//!   restarts, has run history (`schedule_runs` with a `source` field), an
//!   audit trail (`schedule_audit` with X-Amux-Session attribution),
//!   missed-run policy, and timezone semantics. Losing one is losing a
//!   user's intent; every mutation must be attributable.
//! - [`PeriodicTask`] is INTERNAL plumbing. In-memory only, no run history,
//!   no audit, gone on restart by design. It exists so maintenance loops
//!   (rot sweeps, cache refresh, heartbeats) never masquerade as user
//!   schedules — the 451-folds/journal-card lesson generalized: if internal
//!   ticks were rows in `schedules`, the user's schedule list would
//!   accumulate machinery it can neither own nor delete (ethos rule 8), and
//!   every internal tick would demand fake audit attribution (ethos rule 3).
//!
//! There is intentionally NO conversion between the two. A `PeriodicTask`
//! cannot be persisted; a `DurableSchedule` cannot be constructed without a
//! DB row. If you find yourself wanting a hybrid, one of the two lists above
//! tells you which properties your job actually needs.
//!
//! # DUAL-SCHEDULER SAFETY (critical while the strangler fig is live)
//!
//! The Python server on :8822 keeps running and OWNS schedule firing. Both
//! servers read/write the SAME `schedules` / `schedule_runs` rows, so two
//! live firing loops would double-deliver every schedule. Therefore:
//!
//! - The Rust firing loop ships DISABLED. `AMUX_RS_SCHEDULER=1` in the
//!   environment enables real firing; anything else means SHADOW MODE.
//! - In shadow mode [`scheduler::run_scheduler`] still computes next-run
//!   times and, for every schedule that comes due, records what it WOULD
//!   have fired as an `_amux_state_events` row with entity type
//!   `Other("schedule_shadow")` — one event per (schedule, occurrence),
//!   deduped in memory. It touches NEITHER `schedules` nor `schedule_runs`,
//!   so Python's loop is entirely undisturbed. Phase 11 validation compares
//!   these shadow events against Python's actual `schedule_runs` fires.
//! - The CRUD API (`api::schedules`) is always live — creates, edits,
//!   deletes and audit rows are shared state both servers agree on. The ONE
//!   exception is run-now: with firing disabled it answers 409
//!   `{"error":"rust scheduler is in shadow mode","enable":"AMUX_RS_SCHEDULER=1"}`
//!   instead of silently recording a run that delivered nothing (ethos rule
//!   3: the honest refusal beats the quiet lie).
