//! Structured request log + native `/api/logs` (AMUX-2605).
//!
//! Three pieces, one file:
//!
//! 1. **The substrate**: [`middleware`] wraps the WHOLE router (outside the
//!    alias rewrite, so `path` is the RAW path the client sent) and records
//!    every API request into `_amux_request_log` (migration 0010). Rows ride
//!    a bounded channel to a background task that batch-inserts through the
//!    single-writer store — logging can never block or fail a request; on
//!    any error the row is dropped with a `tracing::warn`.
//! 2. **The Logs tab**: `GET /api/logs` + `GET /api/logs/raw`, ported from
//!    the Python server's LIVE handlers (amux-server.py:67673 — the second
//!    pair at :71933 is dead code: Python's dispatch is first-match and the
//!    :67673 block answers first). Same response shapes; where Python reads
//!    its own server.log, this serves the request log UNIONED with the
//!    tracing tail (`~/.amux/logs/server-rs.log`), each line labelled with
//!    its source.
//! 3. **Worker subset**: the `worker` column is derived from the path
//!    (`/api/sessions/{name}/*` -> name, `/api/workers/{id}/*` -> id), so a
//!    per-worker log is a FILTER over the global log (`?worker=`), never a
//!    second log to keep in step.
//!
//! Size discipline (the 25MB-dictation-upload rule): request bodies are
//! NEVER read by the logger — `req_bytes` comes from Content-Length only.
//! `error_body` (first [`ERROR_BODY_CHARS`] chars) is captured ONLY for
//! status >= 400, where bodies are small JSON by construction (and the
//! python proxy already buffers whole responses, so buffering a 4xx/5xx
//! here adds no new cost). `user_agent`/`req_meta` are char-capped.
//!
//! Retention: rows older than `AMUX_REQLOG_RETAIN_DAYS` (default 14; env >
//! server.env > default) are deleted opportunistically — every
//! [`SWEEP_EVERY`] inserted rows — and the delete COUNT is logged, so a
//! sweep that fires is visible and one that never fires is absent from the
//! log (ethos rule 4).

//
// Why a hand-maintained table: axum's Router cannot enumerate its routes, and
// the alternative — a model grepping mod.rs + every module's routes() to
// answer "is PATCH routed at /api/board/statuses/{sid}?" — is exactly the
// expensive token spend AMUX-2610 exists to delete (ethos rule 2: model calls
// for judgment, computation for everything computable). The table is kept
// honest BOTH directions by tests/route_table.rs, which walks every entry
// against the real `api::router()` composition:
//   - a claimed path that is not routed fails (OPTIONS answers the SPA
//     catch-all's signature instead of the route's method router);
//   - a claimed method set that disagrees with what axum actually mounts
//     fails (the 405 `Allow` header is compared as a SET, so both an
//     over-claimed and an under-claimed method are caught), and a negative
//     twin — a method NOT listed — is fired and must 405.
//
// What is deliberately NOT a row:
//   - module-internal catch-alls whose only job is answering a JSON 404
//     (`/api/fs/{*rest}`, `/api/browser/{*rest}`, `/api/dictation/{*rest}`,
//     `/api/scope/{*rest}`, `/api/tags/{*rest}`, `/api/file/{*rest}`) — they
//     are "no such route" answerers, not capabilities;
//   - the SPA shell (`GET /` + GET-only `/{*path}`). Its GET-only-ness is
//     load-bearing for verdicts below: ANY non-GET to an unrouted path
//     answers 405 (with `Allow: GET`) from the catch-all, which reads like
//     "path exists, wrong method" and is really "no such path" — the exact
//     misdiagnosis /api/logs/analyze exists to prevent.

    ///   is out of scope by the prefix. Deliberate — the absolute literals are
    ///   where this class bit — but it means the walk is the ONLY check on a
    ///   relative literal.
    /// - **Only source→table.** A ROUTE_TABLE row with no mount behind it is
    ///   not this test's business; `route_table_matches_the_real_router_both_directions`
    ///   holds that direction.
    /// - **Only the shipped half of each file** (`#[cfg(test)]` onward is cut,
    ///   because test modules mount fixture paths like `/api/echo`).
    /// - **Only the top level of src/api.** The scan is a flat `read_dir`, so
    ///   if anyone ever adds a SUBDIRECTORY there its routes are skipped in
    ///   silence — `found_any` below cannot see that, since the 81 files
