//! `.mdai` computed-file engine (AMUX-3240).
//!
//! A `.mdai` file is markdown-with-metadata: YAML frontmatter declares a list of
//! `sources` (connections to other files, folders, or other `.mdai` files, each
//! carrying a configurable edge `prompt`), plus an optional per-file `model`
//! override; the markdown body is the node's synthesis instruction. Opening a
//! `.mdai` file runs its whole upstream chain: each source is resolved (a `.mdai`
//! source runs first, depth-first, so upstream output is available before this
//! node synthesizes), the resolved sources are assembled into context, and the
//! model is called with the body prompt to populate the output. Sources may be
//! other `.mdai` files, so the graph is an arbitrary DAG.
//!
//! ## `fetch:` — a node that calls an API (AMUX-3994)
//!
//! Frontmatter may declare an HTTP call. The short form is a bare URL:
//!
//! ```text
//! ---
//! fetch: https://api.github.com/repos/mixpeek/amux/issues
//! ---
//! ```
//!
//! That node makes **no model call at all**: the response is its output. Before
//! this, every node ended in a model round trip, so "GET this JSON" paid for
//! reasoning it never used — ethos rule 2, spend model calls on judgment rather
//! than transport.
//!
//! Give the same file a body and it is an ordinary node again: the response
//! joins the assembled sources and the model synthesizes over both. So one
//! mechanism covers "just call an API" and "call an API and reason about it",
//! and which one you get is decided by whether you asked a question.
//!
//! It is still a DAG node either way — other files may list it as a `source`,
//! and it may list `sources` of its own. The full form:
//!
//! ```text
//! ---
//! fetch:
//!   url: https://api.linear.app/graphql
//!   method: POST                 # default GET, case-insensitive
//!   headers: {Accept: application/json}
//!   body: '{"query":"{ viewer { id } }"}'
//!   connector: linear            # bearer resolved from server.env
//!   select: data.viewer.id       # dotted path into a JSON response
//! sources:
//!   - path: context.md
//! ---
//! Summarize what changed since yesterday.
//! ```
//!
//! **Credentials are named, never spelled.** `connector:` names a row from the
//! Connectors registry and the value is read from `~/.amux/server.env`, which is
//! the one place credential values live. A `.mdai` file is data that any worker
//! can write and read, so a key in the frontmatter would be a key in a document.
//!
//! **The URL is not a free target**, for the same reason: `check_fetch_url`
//! allows only http/https and refuses cloud instance metadata, so a written file
//! cannot make the server read credentials its author cannot reach.
//!
//! **Caching.** The fetch runs on every pass — live data is the point, and
//! short-circuiting it would serve yesterday's response forever. The fetched
//! text is folded into the node's input hash instead, so an unchanged response
//! still skips the model call. Fresh data, no wasted judgment.
//!
//! ## Why the single extension `.mdai` and not `.md.ai`
//!
//! macOS reads a trailing `.ai` as an Adobe Illustrator file, so `foo.md.ai`
//! would be misclassified as binary artwork by Finder, Quick Look, and editors.
//! `.mdai` stays plain text everywhere.
//!
//! ## Model selection (ethos D3: do not pin a weak model)
//!
//! The model is resolved once, in [`resolve_model`], from three places in order:
//! a per-file `model:` override, then the `AMUX_HELPER_MODEL` config path (the
//! same knob the rest of the server's helper calls read), then a named
//! fastest-Claude default. The value flows to the call site as a resolved
//! `String`, never a literal spelled at `ModelClient::complete`, so the default
//! moves with config and improves as the fast tier improves, rather than being
//! frozen into the engine.
//!
//! ## Model injection seam
//!
//! Every model call goes through the [`ModelClient`] trait. Production prefers
//! [`ApiModel`] (direct Anthropic API via `reqwest::blocking`, no process boot)
//! when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, falling back to [`CliModel`] (the configured
//! helper CLI) otherwise. Tests inject a deterministic fake,
//! so DAG ordering, cycle detection, and cache short-circuiting are all
//! testable without spending a real model call or a network round trip.
//!
//! ## Observability (ethos: a bug must surface in the logs)
//!
//! Cycles, model failures, and IO failures are logged at WARN with the offending
//! path (and the named cycle chain), and every run endpoint hit rides the
//! structured request log like any other `/api` call, so a cycle that starts
//! firing or a model that starts failing shows up in `/api/logs/analyze` without
//! anyone going and looking for it.
