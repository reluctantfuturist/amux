//! /api/reclaim — disk scan, reclaim findings, treemap, and a quarantine-first
//! cleanup path.
//!
//! Three properties this module exists to get right, each because the obvious
//! implementation gets it wrong:
//!
//! 1. **Reclaim is measured as a `df` delta, never as a sum of file sizes.**
//!    On APFS those disagree by the whole answer. Deleting 22GB of ollama blobs
//!    on 2026-08-16 moved `du` by 22GB and moved `df` by roughly zero, because
//!    24 hourly local Time Machine snapshots still referenced the freed blocks.
//!    A cleanup UI that reports the SUM tells the user it reclaimed space they
//!    cannot see on their own disk — a confident wrong answer, which is worse
//!    than no answer (ethos rule 7). So every batch records free-space before
//!    and after, and `snapshot_held` is surfaced as its own finding.
//!
//! 2. **The scan must not become part of the problem.** It runs on a dedicated
//!    thread with macOS background I/O policy (`setiopolicy_np`), which makes
//!    the kernel deprioritize its reads behind everything else, and yields
//!    periodically. A `du -sh` over this home directory took >3 minutes of
//!    wall-clock during development while load average sat at 95; an
//!    unthrottled walker would have made the machine it is diagnosing slower.
//!
//! 3. **Nothing is deleted on the scanner's judgment.** Quarantine moves a path
//!    aside, keeping it restorable, and purge is a separate explicit act. Every
//!    candidate path must additionally pass `guard_path`, which is a deny-list
//!    of things no heuristic is allowed to touch regardless of how much space
//!    they would free (ethos rule 8 — never bulk-delete user content).
