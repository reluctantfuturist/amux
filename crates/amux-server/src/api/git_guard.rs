//! `POST /api/git/staged-guard` — the shared-checkout staged-state guard.
//!
//! # Invariant comments in this file must be PINNED, not narrated
//!
//! A 2026-08-21 mutation sweep (amux-frustrations, AF-127 follow-up) found
//! four protection-losing invariants here that were correct, deliberate,
//! explained in a comment — and held by nothing: forcing each passed all
//! 1171 tests. This file's comments are good enough to convince a reader an
//! invariant is enforced, which is exactly when nothing goes red. The rule,
//! deliberately NARROW so it stays true: a comment stating an invariant
//! whose violation LOSES PROTECTION (blocks stop firing, records outlive
//! their window, the newest observation gets dropped) must have a test that
//! fails when the enforcing line is removed — mutation-check it before
//! trusting it. Noise-adding invariants are exempt; a rule covering
//! everything becomes a chore and then a lie.
//!
//! # Why this file exists at all
//!
//! The endpoint is called by `.git/hooks/amux-staged-guard`, a script the
//! Python server generated per work_dir and which is therefore **installed on
//! machines and checkouts this repo cannot see**. Python is retired; the
//! generator went with it; the hooks did not. So the contract below is not a
//! design — it is a transcription of what the installed clients already speak,
//! recovered from `git show 792ce1f^:amux-server.py` (`_staged_guard_check`
//! py:19400, `_staged_guard_window` py:19187, route py:71813) and from the
//! generated hook on disk. **The server adapts to the hooks, never the
//! reverse.**
//!
//! Between the rust cutover and this file, `POST /api/git/staged-guard`
//! answered 405 — 1,147 times an hour — and the hook's `except Exception:
//! return 0  # fail open` swallowed every one of them. The guard printed
//! nothing and exited 0 on every commit, fleet-wide, which is precisely the
//! silent-permissiveness failure it exists to prevent (it was already
//! silently skipped once before, AC-261). That is the reason this module
//! reports `undecided` / `degraded` instead of quietly returning an empty
//! verdict: an empty `foreign` list and "I could not see half the fleet" are
//! the same bytes on the wire, and the hook cannot tell them apart unless the
//! server says so (ethos rule 4).
//!
//! # Request (from the hook)
//!
//! ```json
//! {"session": "<name>", "dir": "<git toplevel>", "paths": ["<repo-relative>"],
//!  "op": "commit", "guard_version": 2}
//! ```
//! plus `X-Amux-Session` (or `X-Amux-Worker`). The **header wins** over
//! `body.session`: provenance is the server-verified origin, never body text
//! (AMUX-1768). `op` and `guard_version` are optional — old hooks send
//! neither.
//!
//! # Response (what the installed hooks read)
//!
//! ```json
//! {"ok": true, "classified_paths": ["<repo-relative>"],
//!  "foreign":   [{"path","owner","age_secs","provenance","has_unstaged_changes","why"}],
//!  "shared":    [{"path","owner","peer","age_secs","has_unstaged_changes"}],
//!  "unclaimed": [{"path","has_unstaged_changes"}],
//!  "observations": [{"path","mine_age_secs","observers","provenance","establishes_ownership","why"}],
//!  "cotenants": ["<session>"], "window_secs": 21600}
//! ```
//! Every key is present on EVERY return path, including the disabled and
//! no-cotenant short circuits — python's own comment on that: a caller that
//! reads `d["shared"]` should get `[]`, not `None`. `foreign` non-empty means
//! the hook exits 1 and the commit is blocked.
//!
//! Fields this server ADDS (old hooks ignore them; the v2 hook prints them):
//! `undecided` + `reason` (no verdict was computable — do not read the empty
//! lists as "all clear"), `degraded` (a verdict was computed but may
//! UNDER-report, with the reasons), and `hook_outdated` (the caller sent no
//! `guard_version`, so it is a pre-rust hook that swallows server errors).
//!
//! # The classification, verbatim from python
//!
//! Attribution comes from each session's own JSONL transcript, not from git
//! state — git state is exactly what is ambiguous when N agents share one
//! index (AMUX-1730). Sessions are paired by **git repo root**, not by CC_DIR
//! string (AMUX-2337: in a monorepo those differ, and pairing by string left
//! 23 of 36 lanes invisible to the guard while it returned 200).
//!
//! - `foreign`  — a peer's first-hand write, no first-hand write of yours:
//!   BLOCKED. Also fires when you have no record of the path at all.
//! - `shared`   — you edited it too (or it is yours with unstaged changes):
//!   warned, never blocked. Blocking would deadlock a genuinely shared file.
//! - `unclaimed` — staged, and NO session has an edit record inside the
//!   window: warned. Not blockable (no owner to defer to) but silence here is
//!   what let 762e06e sweep a peer's staged work.
//!
//! # A CLAIM DOES NOT EXIST UNTIL THE COMMAND THAT MADE IT FINISHES
//!
//! Measured 2026-08-30, and worth stating here because it cost two wrong
//! diagnoses (AMUX-3904, AMUX-3905) before anyone tested it. Claude Code writes
//! a Bash `tool_use` block to the transcript when the command COMPLETES, not
//! when it starts. Every claim this module derives from Bash is read out of that
//! transcript, so a session that writes a file and then asks the guard about it
//! INSIDE THE SAME COMMAND is asking about a write whose record does not exist
//! yet, and correctly gets `unclaimed`.
//!
//! The probe that shows it, and the reason a reader will otherwise blame the
//! 30-second `EDIT_CACHE_TTL`:
//!
//! ```text
//! cmd A: write + stage + staged-guard -> unclaimed;  transcript -> 0 records
//! cmd B: transcript -> 1 record   AND   staged-guard -> claimed   (same instant)
//! ```
//!
//! Cache staleness would have shown the record PRESENT while the verdict still
//! said unclaimed. It does not; the verdict flips exactly when the record lands.
//!
//! THIS IS FAIL-SAFE IN THE FLOW THAT MATTERS, which is why it is documented
//! rather than fixed. A peer commits in THEIR command, after your writing
//! command ended, so your record is there by then. The only party whose record
//! can be missing is the COMMITTER, about their own in-flight command — and a
//! missing committer record makes `committer_fresher` false, which routes the
//! path to `foreign` and BLOCKS. The lag errs toward refusing a commit, never
//! toward sweeping one.
//!
//! What it DOES break is a self-query used as a probe. If you are testing this
//! module by hand, put the write and the question in separate commands, or you
//! will measure the command boundary and think you found a bug.

/// Staging `api/board.rs` took ~16 lines of a peer's in-flight AMUX-3607 wiring
/// out of the same FILE, including a call to `effective_gate_trail`, which was
/// defined in `db/board_store.rs` and still uncommitted in their tree. The
/// caller's `cargo check` passed and the pre-commit gate passed, both correctly:
/// they check the TREE, which held the peer's definition. Nothing anywhere
/// builds the COMMIT.
///
/// The pathspec rule does not reach this. `git commit -- <paths>` protects
/// against sweeping whole unrelated FILES; the peer's work was in a file the
/// committer was legitimately editing, so file-granular staging takes it whole.
///
/// WHY THIS IS ALMOST FREE: the guard already holds both halves. It knows which
/// staged files a peer co-edited (that is `foreign`/`shared`) and it knows which
/// paths are `dirty`. One cross-reference turns them into the hazard. What it
/// costs is a set intersection over data already in memory.
///
/// IT STATES A FACT, IT DOES NOT POSE A QUESTION, and that is the load-bearing
/// design choice rather than a stylistic one. The guard ALREADY printed the
/// discriminating number for this specimen ("34 insertions / 9 deletions — if
/// that is MORE than you wrote, their work is in it") and its author read past
/// it, because 34 looked about right for the edit they had made. A number
/// matching your expectation is exactly where a check gets skipped. Any remedy
/// that asks the committer to do arithmetic fails the same way.

    // mtimes (proven unreliable for this exact question earlier tonight:
    // amux-helper's env mtime said 98 days idle while it committed the same
    // day). A RUNNING blind cotenant can be mid-edit right now — that stays

    // without the per-name klaxon.

    //
    //   no transcript + RUNNING  -> BLIND. A live lane we cannot see. It may be
    //                               staging work right now, so it gates the
    //                               AC-355 block and stays the loud case.
    //   no transcript + stopped  -> ABSENT. Not a lane the guard cannot see —
    //                               a lane that is not there. No recorded
    //                               activity at all, so there is no invisible

    // sweep target AC-355 exists for. Folding this into a "stopped" or
    // "stale-env" flag re-breaks that case, which is why the two are separate
    // verdicts and separate messages.
