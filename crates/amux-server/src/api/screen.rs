//! `/api/screen/*` — read-only screen capture of the machine amux-server-rs
//! runs on (Ethan's request, 2026-09-15: "how can i enable amux to control my
//! actual computer... i want to be able to see/read ChatGPT app desktop").
//!
//! SAME "hard invariant" shape as `/api/browser` (see that module's header):
//! this always captures the SERVER machine's screen, never asks a remote
//! dashboard viewer to do anything, and artifacts are served through the API
//! rather than as a raw filesystem path a phone across the network cannot
//! read.
//!
//! WHY THE SYSTEM PERMISSION PROMPT, NOT A MANUALLY-ADDED ENTRY: this binary
//! is signed with a stable LOCAL identity (`amux-dev`, see
//! scripts/create-codesign-identity.sh) that has no Apple Developer Team ID.
//! macOS's Screen Recording pane in System Settings routinely refuses to
//! persist an entry added via its own "+" file picker for a binary with no
//! Team ID — confirmed live, 2026-09-15: `codesign -dv` on amux-server-rs
//! shows `TeamIdentifier=not set`, and manually adding it did not stick. The
//! path that DOES work for a self-signed binary is the OS's OWN native
//! prompt, triggered by an actual capture attempt — and because the signing
//! identity is stable across rebuilds, one "Allow" on that prompt persists
//! forever, which is the exact property `amux-dev` exists to provide.
//!
//! SCOPE, deliberately narrow for a first cut: loopback-only (`peer.is_
//! loopback()`), so the tailnet/tunnel-exposed dashboard cannot reach this
//! even with a valid token — a screen capture is far more personal than
//! anything else this server hands out, and "reachable by anything already
//! running on this machine" is a real boundary, not just "did nothing stop
//! me". Whether every one of the fleet's workers should be able to call this
//! (vs. an owner-only gate) is a separate decision Ethan has not made yet —
//! named here rather than guessed at.
