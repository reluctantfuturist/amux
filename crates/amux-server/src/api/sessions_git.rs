//! `GET /api/sessions-git` (AMUX-2599) — the bulk git map the session cards use.
//!
//! One request instead of 80. The SPA calls this on every session refresh
//! (throttled to 20s client-side) and reads three things per session: `branch`,
//! `repo`, and the `_conflict` flag it synthesizes itself by grouping on
//! `repo + branch`.
//!
//! # Shape (python parity, py:66429)
//!
//! An OBJECT keyed by session name, NOT an array:
//! `{"<name>": {"name": "<name>", "branch": "<str>", "repo": "<abs toplevel>"}}`
//! Sessions whose directory has no branch are OMITTED entirely — the client's
//! conflict grouping does a hard `continue` on a falsy `repo`, so a row with an
//! empty branch would be dead weight in every payload.
//!
//! # Why this does not shell git for the branch
//!
//! `sessions_legacy::build_array` already resolves a branch per session,
//! deduped by directory, for the session list the SPA renders alongside this.
//! Computing it a second time here would (a) double the git subprocess load on
//! a 50-session fleet and (b) create two answers to the same question that can
//! disagree — the SPA reads `sess.branch` preferentially and falls back to
//! `gi.branch`, so a disagreement would surface as a badge that changes
//! depending on which fetch landed last. So the branch is REUSED and only
//! `repo` (the one field the session list does not carry) is computed here,
//! one `rev-parse --show-toplevel` per DISTINCT directory.
//!
//! # The cache is not an optimization, it is a load ceiling
//!
//! Every open client polls this. Without the 30s TTL the git subprocess count
//! scales with (clients x sessions), which is the shape that made python add
//! the same TTL. A stale-by-30s branch is correct: branches change on commit
//! cadence, not seconds.
