//! GET /api/usage — provider subscription usage for the Settings meter.
//!
//! The legacy top-level response remains Anthropic's body plus `available`, so
//! older clients keep working. The `providers[]` collection is the complete
//! Settings contract: Claude, Codex, Gemini, and the honest unmetered state for
//! local Ollama. Provider-specific fields stay under their provider row rather
//! than being collapsed into a lowest-common-denominator percentage.
//!
//! # Why the detailed rows do not go through `ProviderAdapter::usage()`
//!
//! The Claude meter used to, and that is why it was dark. The adapter returns
//! NORMALIZED [`UsageWindow`]s for capacity routing, which is a deliberately
//! lossy view: it keeps kind/percent/reset and discards the provider-specific
//! fields this SPA renders — `limits[].scope.model.display_name` (the
//! per-model weekly rows), `limits[].group`, and the exact `kind` spelling
//! the renderer switches on. Re-deriving those from a normalized window is
//! guesswork, so the endpoint consumes the probe DIRECTLY and passes
//! Anthropic's body through verbatim, exactly as Python did. The SPA's
//! `loadUsage()` therefore sees byte-identical fields to the Python server.
//!
//! The adapter is still the owner of the probe — [`probe_usage_raw`] lives in
//! `provider/claude.rs` next to the credential reader, and
//! `ProviderAdapter::usage()` calls the same function. One token
//! acquisition, one HTTP call, two consumers with different honesty
//! requirements: routing needs a number or nothing (Invariant 20), a human
//! needs to know WHICH thing went wrong.
//!
//! # Discriminated degradation (ethos rule 4)
//!
//! The previous single sentence — "no token, expired token, or probe failed"
//! — was true and useless: it is three causes with three different remedies,
//! so nobody could tell a broken login from a transient rate limit, and the
//! meter stayed dark without anyone knowing which to fix. During development
//! (2026-08-09) this host's probe was answering **HTTP 429** with a perfectly
//! valid, unexpired keychain token — a self-healing condition that read as a
//! missing credential. Every cause now has its own reason string, and an HTTP
//! failure carries its status code.
//!
//! # Secrets
//!
//! No response on any path can contain a token. Claude's [`UsageProbe`] cannot
//! carry one, and the Codex/Gemini shapers allow-list quota, plan, and credit
//! fields instead of forwarding either provider's account envelope.
