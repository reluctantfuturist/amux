//! Worker API: CRUD + start/stop/peek (RR-0034; parts of RR-0035 rename/alias
//! and RR-0040 group/env/permissions changes; Invariants 13, 17, 37, 43).
//!
//! Mounted at `/api/workers` inside the `protected` router (api/mod.rs), so
//! every handler sits behind bearer auth; the legacy `/api/sessions/*` paths
//! reach the same handlers through `aliases::alias_layer` (RR-0018a) and are
//! equally protected because the rewrite happens outside auth.
//!
//! Every mutation goes through `Store::write_async` and reports honestly:
//! `applied: false` with no rev/version bump on no-ops (Invariant 37), a
//! `ConfigChangeResult` naming the apply mode and any session swap on config
//! changes (Invariant 43), and `PendingEvent`s for every real change so
//! SSE/delta-sync consumers see it (Invariant 35).
