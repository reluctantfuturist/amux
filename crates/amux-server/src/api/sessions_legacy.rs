// ---- status derivation (AMUX-2589) ---------------------------------------
//
// Python's `status` is its scanner's judgment (pane regex) overridden by a
// fresh self-report (amux-server.py:20201-20263). The Rust server runs no
// scanner (D1: scrapers are the deviation, not the goal), so the honest
// equivalents are, in Python-precedence order:
//   base:  the Python scanner's own LAST PERSISTED judgment — the
//          session.working/idle/waiting transition it writes to
//          `session_events` (py:20268-20270, the D1 report-endpoint shape:
//          a durable store the producer already writes) — guarded against
//          staleness (pre-restart events discarded; an `active` with no
//          pane output for AMUX_ACTIVE_HEARTBEAT_S is not active);
//          falling back to tmux activity (<60s = active, else idle).
//   over:  self_report when fresh, with Python's ASYMMETRIC freshness
//          (py:20233-20263): `idle` does not decay (the only exit is a
//          prompt, which fires UserPromptSubmit -> a new report; window
//          AMUX_HOOKS_LIVE_IDLE_S=86400), `active`/`waiting` do
//          (AMUX_HOOKS_LIVE_S=1800), and a stale `active` report (older
//          than the heartbeat, AMUX_ACTIVE_HEARTBEAT_S=120) never
//          overrides — a long turn is byte-identical to a wedged one.
//   last:  CONTRADICTION — physical evidence overrides a stale `idle`
//          (AMUX-2646, below).
//   "" :   not running.
//
// AMUX-2646 — "it is running but says idle". The asymmetric window above
// says an `idle` report never decays, on the reasoning that "the only exit
// from idle is a prompt, and every prompt fires UserPromptSubmit". That
// premise is false in at least four reachable ways, and each of them leaves
// a lane permanently mislabelled because nothing else in the derivation
// could ever disagree:
//
//   1. The UserPromptSubmit POST is best-effort (`curl -m 2`, no retry). The
//      server re-execs on every save of its own source on a shared checkout,
//      so a dropped report is routine, not exotic.
//   2. `report_post` then REFUSES every `tool-hook` heartbeat for the rest of
//      the turn ("a heartbeat must not resurrect a finished turn",
//      AMUX-2538) — the one signal that could self-heal is suppressed by
//      design, correctly, for a different reason.
//   3. Anything can write any state for any session over `/report`; a hand
//      -run hook test wrote `{"state":"idle","source":"stop-hook-test"}` onto
//      a LIVE working lane and it stuck for 1076s until a human noticed.
//   4. Work resumes without a prompt: a backgrounded command re-invoking the
//      agent, a resumed session, a hookless provider (gemini/codex) whose
//      stale claude-era report outlives its hooks.
//
// A claim that no evidence can contradict is not a status, it is an axiom.
// So `idle` still survives SILENCE for the full 24h — a parked lane must not
// be re-scraped forever, which is the asymmetry's real purpose — but it does
// not survive CONTRADICTION: a pane that is unambiguously mid-turn AND has
// painted within AMUX_IDLE_CONTRADICTION_S overrides an idle report older
// than that same window. Both halves are required, and the "has painted"
// half is what keeps this from re-reading a parked lane's scrollback: a lane
// that quotes "esc to interrupt" in a transcript it wrote hours ago (a real
// self-block here, AMUX-2642) emits no output, so it is never probed.
//
// KNOWN residual, measured 2026-08-09 against the live fleet (114/116
// exact): Python emits "" for a RUNNING session whose pane shows no
// recognizable agent UI (claude exited to a shell). That cell exists only
// in the pane regex; this derivation reads idle for it. Re-implementing
// the regex would deepen D1, so the residual is documented, not coded away.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every active-detection rule bets on provider UI strings (spinner glyph
// ranges, esc-to-interrupt, verb lists), and each new provider or skin change
// costs another regex — the AMUX-3426 middle-dot miss is only the latest
// instance, and its fix is still a string bet. The provider-agnostic fact
// underneath all of them: a generating lane REPAINTS (Claude Code ~6x/s,
// gemini/codex similar) while a parked lane's pane is byte-stable. So: hash
// each freshly captured frame's CONTENT (ANSI-stripped, MINUS the bottom bar
// zone, so a bar-only repaint or an agents-count tick never counts) and call
// a lane churning when the recent window holds several DISTINCT frames.
//
// In-memory on purpose, and the loss mode is named: a restart drops the
// history and churn reads "no evidence" for one window, which degrades to
// exactly today's string-based detection — never to a wrong answer. A lane
// that stops painting falls out of the capture candidate set, so its
// observations age out and churn goes quiet on its own.

/// Distinct content-frames within the window required to call it churning.
/// 1 is a parked pane; 2 can be one legitimate single repaint (a notification
/// landing, a human's pasted line); 3+ inside a minute is something REDRAWING.

/// Distinct content-frames required inside a window that STARTS AT A LANE'S OWN

///
/// [`CHURN_MIN_DISTINCT`]'s 3 buys margin over a fixed 60s window where a
/// legitimate single repaint (a notification, a pasted line) is common. Here the
/// window is bounded by the age of the claim and the frames are the only ones
/// recorded AFTER it, so the thing being excluded is different: a stale
/// post-Stop frame, which is FROZEN and therefore contributes exactly one
/// content hash however many times it is sampled. Two distinct contents means
/// the pane changed after the lane said it was done, which a frozen frame cannot
/// do — and the gate additionally requires a spinner in the same frame.
///
/// It also carries a floor for free. Captures sit behind a 2s response cache, so
/// N distinct frames cannot exist in less than ~2*(N-1) seconds; 2 means the
/// claim is at least a couple of seconds old, which is the repaint lag the
/// contradiction window was written for. Raising this to 3 would push the

    // victims were endpoints that never shell out at all — they just could not
    // get a connection because five copies of THIS function held them.
    //
    // Blocking here is safe: both callers (this handler and graph.rs's
    // fleet_graph) run this function inside spawn_blocking (AF-300), so a
    // wait costs one blocking-pool thread, never an executor slot — the
    // "try_lock, never lock" rule this comment used to state predates that
    // migration and no longer holds.
    //
    // A COLD cache (no snapshot yet — true on every restart) used to bypass
    // the guard entirely: try_lock's Err arm found `c.json` empty and fell
    // through to an INDEPENDENT build, one per concurrent caller. That is
    // the exact N-builders-one-pool failure AR-135 exists to prevent, just
    // gated on "cache empty" instead of "TTL expired" — and it is the worse
    // moment to hit it, since a restart is when every dashboard/fleet client
    // reconnects and hits this endpoint at once. Confirmed live 2026-09-09:
    // a post-restart reconnect burst held `read_pool_exhausted` for minutes
    // (152 failures/60s), sessions_legacy.rs's own single-flight guard doing
    // nothing because it only ever guarded the warm path.
    //
    // Fix, first attempt (2026-09-09 morning): a loser WAITS (bounded 3s) for
    // the in-flight build's result instead of racing it, falling back to an
    // independent build past the deadline. THAT BOUND ALONE DOES NOT BOUND
    // THE BUILDER COUNT: under a single instantaneous burst it works (one
    // straggler, at most), but under SUSTAINED reconnect pressure — the real
    // shape of a restart, where clients keep arriving over many seconds, not
    // in one instant — every new wave of waiters can independently miss the
    // same 3s deadline and each spin up its own build. Confirmed live
    // 2026-09-09 afternoon: read_pool_exhausted recurred in bursts for
    // minutes AFTER this fix was deployed, box load average at 62 (4 cores),
    // amux-server-rs itself at 400%+ CPU — N independent builds each
    // spawning ~100 subprocesses, stacking faster than any of them finished,
    // which is the same failure this whole guard exists to prevent, just
    // arriving in waves instead of one instant.
    //
    // FINAL SHAPE: exactly ONE builder. The former fallback lock started a
    // second identical fleet scrape immediately whenever two clients arrived
    // on a cold cache. On the live 127-lane fleet that doubled hundreds of
    // tmux captures, made tmux miss its own deadlines, and stretched both
    // builds long enough that every later caller got the persistent
    // "Worker updates are unavailable" banner. A fallback doing the same work
    // against the same substrate cannot rescue a slow primary; it only makes
    // that substrate slower.
    //
    // Runtime reports preserve the last structurally safe snapshot. While one
    // caller refreshes it, every other caller may serve that snapshot even if
    // its status epoch is old. Structural/config changes still clear it, so a
    // peer can never see a worker that was just isolated or deleted.

// AMUX-2646 — "it is running but says idle".
//
// The frames below are VERBATIM captures of the live fleet on 2026-08-09,
// not constructed ones. That matters: the convenient fixture is convenient
// precisely because it lacks the property that made the incident. Two of
// these were built by hand first and were wrong in ways that would have made
// the suite pass against the bug —
//
//   * a "generating" frame with `esc to interrupt` on the bar. The lane that
//     was actually mislabelled (`amux-rust`) had NO such bar; its only mark
//     was a live spinner. A suite built on the first frame alone would have
//     been green against the specimen it exists for.
//   * an "idle with background agents" frame carrying `esc to interrupt` on
//     the bar — the shape of the theory `pane_bar_says_generating` records
//     itself REJECTING ("empty ❯ + esc to interrupt = idle with background
//     agents"). Whether that frame exists decides whether the override below
//     is safe at all, and it had never been measured either way. It was here:
//     across four live lanes, this Claude Code build prints `esc to interrupt`
//     only while the MAIN turn is generating — an idle lane with two agents
//     shows `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← 2 agents` and
//     a completed-turn marker (`✻ Churned for 2m 57s`). So the bar is a sound
//     work signal, and the rejection in that function was right for a reason
//     nobody had confirmed. IDLE_WITH_AGENTS below is the real frame; if a
//     future Claude Code starts painting `esc to interrupt` for background
//     agents, that test goes red and this override needs rethinking, which is
//     the whole point of keeping the frame rather than a paraphrase of it.
