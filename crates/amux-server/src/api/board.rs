//! Board API (RR-0049 routes + 409 gate contract + force audit; RR-0055
//! archive/restore; the list shape RR-0053's auto-capture will write into).
//!
//! Mounted at `/api/board` inside the `protected` router (api/mod.rs). This
//! is the STRANGLER-FIG surface: it serves the same `issues` rows the Python
//! server serves, in the same shapes the Python dashboard/CLI already parse —
//! a bare JSON array from the list, the `gate not acknowledged` 409 body the
//! CLI's `--checked` flow is built around, `X-Amux-Truncated` headers on the
//! capped list. Interop mappings live in `db::board_store`.
//!
//! Every status change routes through core's `apply_transition` — one state
//! machine, one code path (Invariant 3); nothing here hand-rolls a status
//! write. Gate refusals carry core's `WhyBlocked` list alongside the Python
//! keys, force bypasses are audited into the card's own log (ethos rule 6:
//! the Python board claimed force-is-logged while nothing logged it), and
//! no-op PATCHes report `applied: false` with `rev` unmoved (Invariant 37).

// — and a 404 body `{"error":"not found"}` IS an object, so it was assigned
// wholesale. Every `sessionGates[worker][status]` lookup then missed, and the
// user's per-worker gates rendered as if they had been DELETED. A 404 that
// deserializes into the success path is not a missing endpoint, it is a silent
// data-loss illusion (ethos rule 4: the wrong answer must be visible).

/// Designate a card whose owning lane is ISOLATED (AMUX-3713, Ethan: "the card

///
/// An isolated worker is a raw agent with the harness stripped: hidden from the

/// all of that — `desktop` owns 25 and not one said so — so a peer reading the
/// board saw an ordinary card with an ordinary session name and no indication

/// AMUX-2796: work routed to a lane that cannot receive it.
///
/// IN A HELPER BOTH PATHS CALL, because the first version lived in `list_body`
/// and the single-card GET does not go through it — `get_item` calls
/// `detail_body` directly. The test drove `list_body(row, slim=false)` and
/// passed while the live detail endpoint returned nothing, which is ethos rule
/// 7's wrong-layer failure exactly: a real property asserted in a place the
/// shipped request does not flow through. Verifying against the running server
/// is what caught it.
///
/// Resolved through `session_is_isolated`, the same predicate the fleet filter
/// and the send guard consult, so a card cannot claim a reachability the send
/// path disagrees with.
/// Publish whether this card still claims live work, BESIDE the fields a
/// consumer would otherwise derive it from (AF-555).
///
/// A row ships 48 fields including `status` and `archived` and, until this,
/// nothing that answered the question every consumer actually asks. So every
/// consumer derived it, and a derivation nobody publishes is a derivation that
/// diverges. gtm-engine's `is_active_card` read status and never `archived`,
/// so an archived card in a dispatchable status suppressed a hand-raiser
/// breach page while reaching nobody — board_drive excludes archived from
/// dispatch and every closing verb refuses it, so the alarm went quiet because
/// of a card that can be neither worked nor closed. 785 cards are archived
/// while holding a non-terminal status, so the ambiguity is not rare.
///
/// `live_reason` is here because a bare boolean cannot say WHY, and "false"
/// with no reason is the shape a consumer misreads next. It names which of the
/// four rules fired.
///

// ---- POST /api/board/{id}/status-request · /status-update ----------------

// The D1-exit pair (AMUX-2174), and the ethos inverse of terminal scraping:
// amux does not INFER a card's status, it routes a request and the owning
// session's own model AUTHORS the answer onto the card. ethos.md records this
// as the reason the board is the source of truth.
//
// Both were lost in the Rust cutover and answered 405 with an EMPTY body, which
// is the worst available failure for this pair, because every layer that
// mentions them kept telling the fleet to use them:
//   - `amux board ask` / `amux board status-update` (the CLI's own help)
//   - the SPA card menu's "ask for status" (`_askCardStatus`, app.js)
//   - the advance nudge: "post a status-update / mark its blocker"
//   - the board contract's `board_is_source_of_truth` clause
// This is AMUX-2140's shape a second time: following the sanctioned instruction
// exactly is what produced the failure. It also escaped the route census,
// because that enumerates SPA and CLI call sites and the CLI reaches these by
// hand-rolled curl — so the endpoint the CLI most depends on is exactly the one
// the "does every caller have a route" invariant could not see.

/// The size cap for a status update. Python applied 1200 (py:69770) on the theory
/// that an update is a SUMMARY, not a transcript sink. But 1200 chars silently
/// amputated real cross-group HANDOFFS mid-sentence and still returned
/// {"ok":true} (AMUX-3079), so the default is raised, made configurable, and any
/// truncation is now reported loudly by the handler rather than being silent.
