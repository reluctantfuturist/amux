//! Command/message history API: `/api/history` over the live `cmd_history`
//! table, ported from the Python handlers (GET list/counts/sessions, POST
//! append, POST import, DELETE clear).
//!
//! Python parity decisions, recorded so they are not "fixed" later:
//! - The stored `type` values are kept as-is; `kind` (human/session/schedule/
//!   amux/unknown) and `queued` are DERIVED on read, like `_msg_kind`/
//!   `_msg_is_queued`.
//!
//!   CORRECTED 2026-08-26 (AMUX-3737). This block used to record "unknown types
//!   read as human, because that is the reading that gets a message looked at
//!   rather than filtered away" as a deliberate Python-parity decision. The
//!   reasoning is about VISIBILITY and it is sound; the conclusion does not
//!   follow, because `human` is not the only visible bucket. That default
//!   silently attributed 355 machine-generated `pickup` nudges to a person, and
//!   Ethan caught it from a screenshot rather than from anything here. Unknown
//!   types now read as `unknown`: just as visible, and honest about what it
//!   does not know. Kept as a note rather than deleted, because a stale
//!   rationale is what made the default look considered.
//! - Every filter (kind, q, session, group) is applied IN SQL, before the
//!   LIMIT — the page-vs-corpus gap (AMUX-2548) is exactly what the Python
//!   comments warn about.
//! - `?group=` resolves members from the session env files
//!   (`<amux home>/sessions/*.env`, `CC_TAGS`), skipping names in
//!   `blocked-sessions.txt` — the same source Python's `list_sessions()`
//!   reads tags from. An empty group matches NOTHING (`1=0`), never
//!   everything.
//! - Secret redaction runs on the way IN on both POST paths, with the same
//!   pattern table as `_redact_secrets` (AMUX-2525), and fails OPEN: a
//!   capture that loses the prompt is worse than one that stores it.
//! - `?sessions=`/`?counts=` are Python-truthy flags: any non-empty value
//!   (including "0") selects the branch, because `parse_qs` drops empty
//!   values and a non-empty list is truthy.
//! - One deliberate deviation: a non-numeric `?limit=`/`?offset=` falls
//!   back to the default (500/0) where Python's bare `int()` answers 500.
