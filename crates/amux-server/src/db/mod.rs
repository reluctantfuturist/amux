//! SQLite store: WAL mode, single-writer task, read pool, migrations,
//! global revision counter (RR-0019, Invariants 35/36).
//!
//! Concurrency design (plan §SQLite concurrency design):
//! - One dedicated writer thread owns the only write connection. Mutations
//!   arrive over an mpsc channel as closures; the writer applies each inside
//!   a transaction that ALSO bumps the global revision when the mutation
//!   reports itself as a real change. Python's GIL serialized writes by
//!   accident; this serializes them by construction, so `SQLITE_BUSY` cannot
//!   happen under load.
//! - Readers come from an r2d2 pool of read-only connections with a 5s busy
//!   timeout.
//! - The revision lives in `_amux_rev` (single row) and is returned from
//!   every mutation so SSE/delta-sync can publish revisioned StateEvents
//!   (Invariant 35).
