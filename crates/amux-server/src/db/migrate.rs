//! Migration runner (RR-0019).
//!
//! Migrations are numbered SQL files embedded at compile time from
//! `crates/amux-server/migrations/`. Applied in order inside one exclusive
//! transaction each, tracked in `_amux_migrations`. Two special forms:
//!
//! - Plain SQL statements: executed as a batch.
//! - `-- ADDCOL: <table> <column> <decl...>` directive lines: applied as
//!   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` ONLY when the column is absent. SQLite has
//!   no `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, and the baseline schema mirrors a live
//!   Python database whose tables may or may not already carry the column —
//!   the directive makes the migration idempotent against both shapes.
//!
//! The Python server must be able to keep opening the same DB file after
//! these run (Phase 11 rollback requirement), so migrations are ADDITIVE
//! ONLY: no drops, no renames, no type changes.

/// full-scanned ~79,000 rows for each of 7,281 terminal cards, inside the
/// exclusive transaction a migration runs in, at server startup, and the server
/// was unreachable for 186 seconds. Every test was green throughout, because
/// migration tests apply their SQL to four fixture rows — and on four rows an
/// index scan and a table scan are indistinguishable. Correctness and cost are
/// different questions and the suite only ever answered the first.
///
/// WHY THE PLAN AND NOT A ROW COUNT. The obvious fix is a fixture with realistic
/// row counts, and it is the wrong one: it needs a threshold, the threshold has
/// to be guessed, and a migration that is 10x too slow on 79,000 rows still
/// passes on whatever number gets picked. Ethos rule 7 — prefer the
/// structurally-absent signal over the tuned parameter. `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`
/// answers the actual question at any table size, in microseconds, on an empty
/// database.
///
/// THE RULE: inside a CORRELATED subquery, every table access must use an index.
/// A correlated subquery runs once per outer row, so an unindexed access there is
/// O(outer x inner) by construction — that is the shape that took the server
/// down, and it is a property of the SQL, not of how much data happens to exist.
/// A `SCAN` at the top level is left alone: one pass over the table being
/// updated is unavoidable and is O(n) once.
///
/// MEASURED, not assumed, because the obvious matcher does not work. The plan
/// prints the ALIAS, not the table name, so a check that greps for
/// `_amux_state_events` finds nothing and passes on the incident itself:
///
///   without the index:  `--SEARCH e
///   with the index:     `--SEARCH e USING INDEX idx_amux_state_events_entity
///
/// Note also that it is SEARCH in both cases. A `SCAN` vs `SEARCH` check — the
