//! Board store: the Python `issues` table <-> core [`Task`] interop shim
//! (Phase 2, RR-0049/RR-0053/RR-0055; strangler-fig rule from the plan).
//!
//! THE RUST API READS AND WRITES THE SAME ROWS THE PYTHON SERVER SERVES.
//! Phase 11's rollback requirement is that the Python server keeps working
//! against this DB at any moment, so every mapping here preserves the Python
//! vocabulary byte-for-byte:
//!
//! - `issues.id` is the wire id ("AMUX-123"). Core [`TaskId`]s are derived
//!   deterministically from it ([`internal_id`]) and never persisted.
//! - `status` is stored in the Python spelling (`needsyou`, not `needs_you`).
//!   Reads accept both; writes preserve whatever spelling the row already
//!   used ([`status_to_db`]) so a Rust write never rewrites Python's
//!   vocabulary in shared rows.
//! - `created`/`updated` are unix INTEGER seconds (0001_baseline: `created
//!   INTEGER NOT NULL`), never RFC3339 strings.
//! - `log` is the append-only history; lines are `` `HH:MM` <text> ``
//!   exactly as `_append_board_log` writes them ([`append_log`]).
//! - id minting replicates `_next_issue_id` / `_prefix_from_session` over
//!   the shared `issue_counters` table, so the two servers can never mint
//!   colliding ids.
//! - `deleted IS NULL` (soft delete) is filtered in EVERY query, and
//!   [`save_patched`] deliberately never touches Python-owned columns it
//!   does not model (`creator`, `created`, `notified`, `gcal_event_id`,
//!   `deleted`).

///
/// NO TIME WINDOW, deliberately. The delay this must tolerate is however long the
/// lane takes to reach a turn boundary, which is unbounded by design; the incident
