//! Task attempts (RR-0052, Invariant 1: every worker execution belongs to a
//! task attempt).
//!
//! A lease is the CURRENT holding; an attempt is the durable record of each
//! one. A card on its fourth try reads as attempt #4 with three recorded
//! outcomes, not as a `lease_generation` of 8. The only writer is
//! [`record_lease_change`], called at the two lease choke points after the card
//! is saved, so a refused transition never leaves an attempt behind, and the
//! attempt log and the lease can only disagree when a path bypasses both.
//! [`reconcile_orphans`] closes those.
//!
//! WHY THE TABLE IS ENSURED HERE AND NOT IN A NUMBERED MIGRATION. On
//! 2026-09-14 the live database recorded migration 69 as
//! `0069_worker_lifecycle`, applied by a dirty build from the shared checkout
//! while origin/main registered only 68 (AMUX-4533). `migrate.rs` skips a
//! version it has already applied without reading the name, so a
//! `0069_task_attempts` landing on origin would boot green on that box and
//! never create this table, and every lease change would then fail its write
//! transaction. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` at the point of use cannot be
//! skipped that way. Move it into a migration once the version collision is
//! resolved on origin.
//!
//! Outcome vocabulary (NULL while the attempt runs):
//! done | review | blocked | parked | needs_input | failed | discarded |
//! released (put back in todo by a worker or human) | abandoned (the lease
//! reaper reclaimed it from a silent holder) | reassigned (another lane took
//! the lease) | orphaned (the card left its lease through a path that bypassed
//! both choke points).
