//! The invariant checks themselves (AMUX-2622).
//!
//! EVERY check in here is derived from an incident that actually happened in
//! this repo, and each one tests the INVARIANT the incident revealed rather
//! than the implementation detail that broke (spec §29). The incident is named
//! in the doc comment so the next person can tell whether a "simplification"
//! would re-open it.
//!
//! Each check ships with a negative control at the bottom of this file: a test
//! that INJECTS the failure and asserts the check reports it. Per AMUX-2624, a
//! check that has never been demonstrated failing is not a valid health check —
//! this repo has shipped a green `if True:` fixture, a grep that could not
//! match, and a spin-catcher that ranked sleeping threads, all of which "passed".

/// retirement while `/api/sessions/<n>/send` returned 200. The installed CLI

/// tmux keystroke injection — unstamped, unaudited, delivery unverified — and
/// two long inter-session messages were lost before a human noticed.

/// have caught the /api/workers/<name>/send 405 before production".

/// Deliberately compares against the ROUTER'S OWN TABLE rather than a
/// hand-written expectation list, and normalises `{param}` segments, so adding

/// them, in front of this process, in the deployment where they exist at all.
///
/// NOT an environment branch (single-codebase rule): these are not served by

/// them" is true everywhere and needs no `if IS_CLOUD`. Verified 2026-08-11
