# SessionStart hook: say out loud, at the one moment it matters, whether this
# session is about to build on something stale.
#
# Two DIFFERENT staleness axes bit in one session on 2026-08-05, which is why
# this checks both:
#
#   1. The CHECKOUT was ~110 commits behind origin/main. Work got built on a
#      stale base; one fix turned out to duplicate a fix upstream already had,
#      and the rebase that followed conflicted twice.
#   2. The INSTALLED CLI (~/.local/bin/amux) was a Jul-31 copy missing the
#      `status-update` verb. It fell through to help and exited 0, so three of
#      the owner's status requests were silently swallowed (AMUX-2140 shape).
#
# Design constraints, each one deliberate:
#
#   * It FETCHES, never pulls. This is a shared checkout — CLAUDE.md records a
#     peer's `git pull --rebase` replaying another session's unpushed commit
#     onto origin. A hook that rewrites the working tree can destroy in-flight
#     work belonging to a session that is not even running right now. Report
#     and recommend; the human decides (ethos rule 8).
#   * It FAILS OPEN. Offline, no remote, detached HEAD, missing files — every
#     failure path exits 0 silently. A freshness check that blocks a session is
#     worse than the staleness it detects.
#   * It is SILENT when everything is current, so the one time it speaks is
#     signal rather than another banner to scroll past.

    # Behind alone is recoverable: pull, and your work still reaches origin.
    # Behind AND ahead means no fast-forward, so the hourly sync job refuses
    # (correctly — it must never rewrite a shared tree) and the append strands.
    #
    # This block used to say "until a HUMAN reconciles it" and to send the
    # session off to a clone that is current. Both were wrong on the canonical
    # checkout, which is where most lanes read this (AF-95, 2026-08-19): a plain
    # `git merge origin/main` reconciled 28-ahead/8-behind with no human, no
    # rewritten SHA, and one conflicted file; and "go log in a current clone" is
    # unfollowable when this IS the only clone — ethos rule 3, a constraint with
    # no honest path forward, shipped by the hook that exists to prevent a
    # different version of the same loss.
    #
    # Merge, not rebase, is the recommendation on purpose: a merge preserves
    # every lane's SHA and `--abort` restores exactly, so it is safe for one lane
    # to run unilaterally on a tree it shares with fifty others. Nothing here
    # PUSHES — that stays the human's (ethos rule 8), and the Deploy section of
    # CLAUDE.md records why.
    #
    # The reason this is worth its own line rather than folding into the count
    # above: the failure is SILENT AND WRITE-SHAPED. A stale checkout announces
    # itself the moment you pull. Appending to `frustrations.md` here succeeds,
    # prints nothing, and reaches nobody. On 2026-08-17 four entries went in
    # this way — that copy held 25 entries while origin held 124 — and it was
    # noticed only by chance, days later (AEAB-18).
    #
    # Names frustrations.md specifically because it is the append-only shared
    # file a session is INSTRUCTED to write on its own initiative, so it is the
    # one that gets stranded without anybody choosing to risk it.

    # Both arms above hand out `git merge origin/main` as THE remedy. On
    # 2026-09-01, in this checkout, that command exited 2 without starting:
    #
    #   error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
    #           crates/amux-server/src/runtime_jobs/commit_nudge.rs
    #   Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
    #
    # "abort is clean" describes `git merge --abort`, which never becomes
    # reachable because the merge never begins. And git's own two suggestions are
    # both forbidden on a shared checkout: committing a peer's file lands their
    # work under your name, stashing it takes it out of their worktree while they
    # are in it. So the hook named a state, named the one command for it, and
    # that command could not run, with no third option offered anywhere. That is
    # ethos rule 3, shipped by the hook whose whole job is to prevent a silent
    # loss.
    #
    # A safe third option existed and was one comparison away. The blocking
    # file's worktree bytes were byte-identical to origin's copy: ts-gke's
    # TG-3343 work, already merged upstream, unstaged only because this checkout
    # was behind. Discarding it was provably lossless. Two lanes instead read
    # those 184 lines as a peer mid-edit and routed around them, and the checkout
    # stayed unreconciled through both.
    #
    # `drop_paths_identical_to_origin()` in commit_nudge.rs already computes this
    # comparison for the idle nudge. The surface every lane reads at SessionStart
    # did not (ethos rule 1: capability that exists but does not reach).
    #
    # The two verdicts are deliberately asymmetric. IDENTICAL earns a printed
    # command, because the bytes are recoverable from the remote and the claim is
    # checkable in one line. DIFFERENT earns no destructive command at all: that
    # is somebody's live work, and whose it is cannot be derived here — mtime on

# ── Axis 2b: are the INSTALLED GIT HOOKS the ones in this checkout? ──────────
#
# Same failure as the CLI axis directly above, one layer down and with worse
# consequences, because a hook's staleness is INVISIBLE: a missing verb at least
# prints help, while a missing guard just... does not guard, and looks exactly
# like nothing being wrong.
#
# Measured 2026-08-23. Every checkout on this machine — ~/amux,
# ~/Developer/amux and ~/Projects/amux-gtm — had `.git/hooks/pre-commit` dated
# Aug 5, eighteen days old, while `scripts/git-hooks/` was current. `guard_version`
# appeared 0 times in the installed hooks and 3 times in the repo's. And
# `.git/hooks/pre-push` never called `append-only-push-guard` at all, so the
# guard added to stop a stale republish silently reverting pushed entries in
# frustrations.md (MG-1483, 10 entry-lines lost) had never run here.
#
# NOTHING WAS WATCHING FOR THIS, which is the point of the axis and is worth
# stating precisely, because I first got it wrong. The server does log
# "[staged-guard] OUTDATED HOOK: <session> in <repo> sent no guard_version ...
# Reinstall: scripts/install-hooks.sh" — 128 times over 8 days here — and it
# reads exactly like a file-staleness detector. It is not one. git_guard.rs sets
# it from the REQUEST BODY:
#
#     let guard_version = obj.get("guard_version").as_i64().unwrap_or(0);
#     let hook_outdated = guard_version < 2;
#
# so any caller that omits the field is "outdated" by construction, and
# git-shared-guard.py omits it on most of its posts. It discriminates the CALLER,
# not the file (amux-frustrations, AF-156, who found this and were right). Its
# remedy is also unwalkable — reinstalling installs the same source that omits
# the field, so the warning returns immediately, which is AMUX-2140's shape.
#
# So a CONTENT diff is not a second spelling of that flag; it is the check that
# did not exist. Bytes are the only thing that can distinguish "this file is not
# the one in the checkout" from "this caller did not say who it was", and only
# the first is what a session needs to know at start. I cited that log line as
# evidence for file staleness before reading the code that emits it — the
# staleness was real and independently measured (mtimes, and
# append-only-push-guard absent entirely), but the flag was never evidence for
# it. A message that names a plausible cause is not a measurement of it.
#

# less this can say about it, and a MISSING axis is indistinguishable from an
# axis that found nothing. The instrument is subject to the condition it measures.
#
# Not hypothetical. On 2026-08-22 a session started in ~/Developer/amux, 1278
# commits behind, and ran the Aug 5 copy of this file: `grep -c "RUNNING SERVER
# is"` returns 0 there, so the deploy axis did not exist and the banner never
# mentioned that the fleet was 23 commits behind. That was found by hand, four
# hours and five merged PRs into the session. Every axis added since makes it
# worse, because there is more that can be silently absent.
#
# The fetch above already happened, so comparing this file against origin's copy
# costs nothing extra. Content, not a commit count: a file can be stale without
# any commit touching it in this checkout's history, and bytes are what decide
# whether an axis is present.
