#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every failure mode this scanner has is a QUIET one: it prints
# a clean report and the report is wrong. There is no crash to notice.
#
#   - The Mixpeek ledger uses a checkbox format, the amux one uses fields. If the
#     Mixpeek parser stops matching (their format drifts, a heading changes), it
#     returns [] and every cross-repo cluster silently becomes amux-only. The
#     report still prints, still says "measured", and Mixpeek reads as clean.
#     That is the exact shape of the failure this fleet has 41 ledger entries
#     about, so cell C is the most important one in the file.
#   - `continue` is how Ethan drives the fleet every evening. Counting it as a
#     restatement of the idle-stall rule fired that class on normal operation
#     (11 hits in one window, 7 of them one broadcast). Cell D pins the filter.
#   - He pastes documents under his instructions. Matching rule classes against
#     the pasted body attributes a peer's words to him: it scored "permissions"
#     on a message whose instruction was "clear the backlog". Cell E pins that.
#   - cmd_history.ts is ms and issues.created is seconds. Mixing them makes
#     every card 56,000 days old and every lane look like it closed nothing:
#     both look like findings. Cell F pins the warning that catches a unit flip.
#
# Cells run the SHIPPED script against a synthetic store via AMUX_DB /
# MIXPEEK_REPO, rather than restating its logic: simulating what you believe
# the code does cannot catch it doing something else (ethos rule 7).
