# UTILITY, not the old Python server: audits frustrations.md CARD: pointers against the live board over HTTP (server-agnostic).
"""Audit frustrations.md's CARD: pointers against the live board (AF-28).

The protocol rests on this field. `.claude/rules/frustrations.md` requires every entry to
link a card ("a frustration without a CARD: is a complaint, with one it is work somebody
can pick up"), and the deletion protocol keys an author's confirmation to the entry->card
pair. AF-352 now also permits independent retirement of objective claims from
unreachable authors, with the actual verifier recorded. Nothing originally validated
the pointer, so on 2026-08-09 five of thirty-four entries queued for
deletion pointed at cards about something else entirely — one of them another session's
OPEN card, which was seconds from receiving "validated, deleting" text.

Why the field rots by construction, rather than by carelessness:
  - ids are hand-typed into markdown, with no write path that could check them
  - boards are per-instance, so an id valid on one board silently names a different card
    on another (AC-*, AMUX-*, AH-*, MS-* are not one namespace)
  - supersede entries get filed under the ORIGINAL entry's card id, so one id legitimately
    covers several entries and "delete AC-300" is ambiguous
From the file alone, a stale id and a colliding id are indistinguishable.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 problems found, 2 could not reach the board AND nothing
structural was wrong (NOT a pass — an unreachable board means unchecked, and this says
so rather than exiting 0).

The "AND nothing structural was wrong" is the AEAB-19 fix, and it is the whole contract:
structural problems are decidable without a board, so they exit 1 whether or not the
board answered. Previously the unreachable branch returned a bare 2 and threw the
structural verdict away — and since CI never has a board and treats 2 as a pass, the
gate could not fail there at all.

    Added 2026-08-14 at amux-cloud's suggestion, after their catch. A session
    (me) audited this file with an ad-hoc parser that split entries on `DATE:`.
    Field ORDER varies here — plenty of entries put STATUS: above DATE: — so
    every such entry's STATUS bound to the PREVIOUS entry and it inherited the
    NEXT one's. The error ran in the only direction that costs something: OPEN
    entries reading as `fixed`, i.e. proposed for DELETION, which is the single
    irreversible step in the validate-and-delete loop. An open entry recording a
    live, thrice-regressed incident was on that list.

    The discriminator existed the whole time and nobody was routed to it: this
    script said 122 entries, the ad-hoc parse said 127. Both numbers were read in
    the same session and never compared. So the fix is not "write better
    parsers" — it is to make the disagreement ANNOUNCE ITSELF from the canonical
    tool, because the next person will also write an ad-hoc parse and will also
    have no reason to suspect it.

# capability nobody is enrolled in is decoration). The audit already parses AREA,
# already runs in CI via scripts/test-frustrations-audit.sh, and is already what
# people run before touching this file. A separate `frustration_clusters.py`
# would have to be remembered; this cannot be, because it prints on every run.
#
# IT REPORTS AND DOES NOT ACT. No card is filed, nothing is prioritised for
# anyone. 273 board cards were created in the 24h before this was written, and

# AF-173. THE DELTA, WITHOUT A SCHEDULER AND WITHOUT NEW STORAGE.

# that already exist". For this instrument it needs neither: frustrations.md is
# in git, so its history is already recorded and the change is a query.
#
# Why that matters more than the convenience: every instrument here reports a
# LEVEL (81 entries, 25 open in `instruments`, 2,523 nudges), and a level tells
# you the machine is on. Only the delta answers "did the fixes reduce the
# friction". Its first run said something a level could not: on 2026-08-23,
# across ~28 shipped fixes and 11 retired entries, every cluster was flat or
# GROWING (instruments 22->25, attribution 8->10, cli 3->6). Detection is
# outpacing repair.
#
# READ-ONLY and on demand: no cadence, nothing scheduled, no fleet-wide cost.
# Whether this is ever reported on a schedule is the owner's call (AF-173 is
# needs:you for exactly that), and adding another scheduled emitter to a fleet
# already spending 72% of its plan on background turns is not a decision an
