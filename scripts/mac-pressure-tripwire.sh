# mac-pressure-tripwire.sh — page BEFORE the kernel starts killing processes.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-14 the box sat at kernel memory pressure level 2
# with swap at 85,639 of 86,016 MB, and the only reason anyone knew was that
# Ethan happened to look. It cleared on its own within the hour (level 1, swap
# down 18.4 GB, no reboot), so nothing was lost that time. The next one is a
# coin flip: at level 4 the kernel's jetsam kills largest-first, which on this
# box is fseventsd and then the claude sessions.
#
# WHAT IT WATCHES, and why these three:
#   - kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level. The kernel's own verdict. 1 normal,
#     2 warn, 4 critical. Level 2 is NOT alerted: it was observed oscillating
#     1 <-> 2 within ten minutes on 2026-09-14 and clearing without help, so
#     paging on it would train the alarm to be ignored.
#   - fseventsd RSS. SIP-protected and unkillable (csrutil enabled, and the
#     binary carries the `restricted` flag), so a reboot is the only thing that
#     clears it. It sits around 8 GB here and is the largest single process.
#     NOTE, and this is why the reading below is a median: its RSS is extremely
#     volatile. Samples on 2026-09-14 within fifteen seconds: 2.87, 8.13, 8.48,
#     8.57, 12.83 GB. Do NOT infer a growth rate from two samples; I did, and
#     reported "growing several GB per hour" to Ethan on MO-3326, which the very
#     next sample contradicted. A threshold on a smoothed value is honest here;
#     a trend line from spot reads is not.
#   - swap free. The last cushion before the kernel has nowhere to put pages.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not kill anything, stop any lane, or
# restart any daemon. Every remedy for these conditions is Ethan's under the
# 24/7 rule in ~/Dev/CLAUDE.md, so this reports and pages; it never acts.
#
# The alarm is a fire alarm (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md: "USE VERY SPARINGLY"), so it
# fires only on conditions a human must act on, and at most once per cooldown.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mac-pressure-tripwire.sh           # check, page if a threshold trips
#   scripts/mac-pressure-tripwire.sh --dry-run # never page, just print
