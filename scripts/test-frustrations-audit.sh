# AEAB-19 — the frustrations.md gate must be able to FAIL, with no board reachable.
#
# It could not. Two independent defects in scripts/frustrations_audit.py, and each one
# alone was enough to make `checks` — the only required status check on main — green
# over a broken file:
#
#   1. the board-unreachable branch returned a bare `2`, discarding whether `problems`
#      was non-empty. CI never has a board (checks.yml says so in its own comment) and
#      treats 2 as a pass, so per-entry structural findings were printed and thrown away
#      on every push.
#   2. `structure_ok = structure_check(...)` was assigned and never read. The drift check
#      whose docstring records it stopping a live incident from being queued for DELETION
#      was advisory by accident.
#
# Both were live. Commit 18590ca8 landed an entry with no `## ` heading — the parser folds
# such a block into the preceding entry — and main went green over it. One defect hid the
# other, which is why this test asserts each failure mode separately rather than just
# "the audit exits non-zero on a bad file".
#
# EVERY case runs with the board pointed at a closed port, because that is CI's condition
# and the condition under which the gate was broken. A version of this test that ran
# against a live board would pass against the OLD code and prove nothing.
#
# The audit resolves frustrations.md as `Path(__file__).parent.parent/frustrations.md`, so
# each case builds a throwaway repo (scripts/ + frustrations.md) and copies the REAL
# script into it — the shipped decision path, not a paraphrase.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure. Wired into .github/workflows/checks.yml.

# (s) THE STRANDED CELLS (AF-229). Everything above runs with the board at a dead
#     port, which is CI's condition — and it means the CARD-resolution half has
#     never been exercised by any test at all. So these cells stand up a fixture
#     board on localhost and point the audit at it. That keeps the new check
#     runnable in CI, where the REAL board is unreachable and always will be.
#
#     What is being pinned: "not on this board" was one output for two states, and
#     they need opposite handling. An unresolved id whose author is a live lane is
#     drainable — ask them. An unresolved id in a prefix namespace this board has
#     never held, by an author absent from the fleet, can never be signed off,
#     because the deletion protocol requires the originating session.
#
#     The discriminator is the PREFIX, not author liveness, and that distinction is
#     load-bearing rather than fussy: amux-rust is not live either, yet AR-114
#     answers HTTP 200 on this board. Judging on liveness alone called six drainable
#     AR-* entries permanently stranded on the first run of this feature. Cell (s3)
#     is that specimen, rebuilt.
