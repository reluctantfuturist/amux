# AMUX-4570: `amux board doing` names the right remedy for each refusal.
#
# THE BUG. The refusal handler in _board_outcome treated any error containing
# "doing" as a WIP refusal. The continuation gate refuses with the codes
# doing_requires_next_action and doing_next_action_not_a_sentence, so a card
# with no next_action printed "Finish or demote the held card ... --override-doing"
# and exited 4. No card was held; the remedy was `amux board next <ID> "..."`.
# Reading only the tail, the obvious move was --override-doing, which cannot
# clear this gate.
#
# WHAT IS PINNED, in both directions. A continuation refusal must print the
# server remedy and exit 1, and must never print the override hint. The real WIP
# refusal (a holding list, error "already holding doing") must still print the
# override hint and exit 4, and the ack gate must still exit 3. Narrowing the WIP
# test in a way that silences the real WIP hint would pass the first half alone.
#
# Runs against a throwaway listener on a random port that answers the one PATCH
# a plain status move sends with a canned body. Nothing here touches a real board.
