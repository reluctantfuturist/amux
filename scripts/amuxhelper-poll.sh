# Amuxhelper: the fleet's one shared, non-LLM executor for pre-approved,
# named runbooks. No new board state — it only ever claims cards already
# reassigned to it (`session=amuxhelper`, `status=todo`) and drives them
# through the SAME todo -> doing -> done/blocked lifecycle every other
# worker uses. See scripts/amuxhelper-runbooks/README.md for the contract.
#
# Deliberately not an agent: there is no LLM in this loop, so there is
# nothing here that can improvise. The only thing this script can ever do
# is run a script that already exists in scripts/amuxhelper-runbooks/, named
# exactly by the card. Adding a new runbook is a reviewed code change, not
# something any session can trigger at runtime.
#
# Run by com.amux.amuxhelper-poll every 5 minutes (see amuxhelper-poll.plist).
