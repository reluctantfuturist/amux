# reap-amux-debris.sh — investigate and reclaim AMUX'S OWN filesystem debris.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a disk cleaner for the machine. `disk_watch`
# (crates/amux-server/src/runtime_jobs/disk_watch.rs) deliberately REPORTS and
# deletes nothing, and that decision stands: of 337 GiB in nominally-regenerable
# paths on this box only 17.3 GiB was untouched for 30 days, so an age cap
# reclaims a rounding error and a size cap deletes build artifacts ~50 lanes are
# actively using. The human's caches stay the human's call (ethos rule 8).
#
# WHAT THIS IS. The debris amux itself leaves behind, where the owner is
# unambiguous and the blast radius is amux's own: temp roots minted by the e2e
# harnesses, snapshot copies taken by the push gates, and scratch git worktrees
# abandoned by finished sessions. Nobody has to weigh whether to keep these —
# the run that made them is over. Measured 2026-09-12 before the first pass:
# 7,774 directories and ~3 GB, and it had been accumulating for weeks because
# `~/.tmp-reaper.sh` defaults to --min-size-mb 200 and 2,389 of them were zero
# bytes.
#
# SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION
#   - only names amux itself mints (exact prefixes below), never a glob of /tmp
#   - only entries idle longer than --age-hours (default 6; these runs finish in
#     minutes, so a live run's root is always far younger)
#   - worktrees only under a temp root or $REPO/scratch, and only when tracked
#     files are clean, every untracked entry is a regenerable build dir
#     (node_modules, target, .venv), HEAD is reachable from a remote-tracking
#     ref (a clean detached worktree can hold the ONLY ref to its commits), and
#     no live process has its cwd inside. `--force` is passed only in the state
#     where the regenerable dirs are all that remain; the main worktree is never
#     a candidate
#   - /private/tmp/claude-501 is never touched: live scratchpad space for every
#     running Claude Code session on this machine
#   - dry run by default; --apply is required to delete anything
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/reap-amux-debris.sh              # investigate, delete nothing
#   scripts/reap-amux-debris.sh --apply      # reclaim
#   scripts/reap-amux-debris.sh --apply --age-hours 24
