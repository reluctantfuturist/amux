# AEAB-17 — `amux board add` must REFUSE an unknown flag, not fold it into the title.
#
# The defect: `add` parsed its arguments as `else title="$*"`, so every flag became
# part of the title with exit 0 and no warning. One log-review run filed five cards
# that way — titles up to 259 chars carrying raw
# `--type blocker --desc-file /private/tmp/.../c26.md` (a scratch path that would not
# exist the next day), empty descs, and the DEFAULT type, so two cards about a
# production outage were gated on "Implemented and merged" + "Tests / lint pass".
# Separately `amux board add --help` FILED A CARD TITLED "--help": the one action taken
# to discover the interface was the action that polluted the board.
#
# These run the REAL dispatch path as a subprocess. Every case below is decided
# BEFORE any network call, which is deliberate and is what makes this runnable in CI
# with no server: a parser that only refused after a successful POST would still have
# created the card. AMUX_API is pointed at a closed port so that if any case ever does
# reach curl, it fails loudly instead of quietly mutating a real board.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure. Wired into .github/workflows/checks.yml.
set -euo pipefail

# AF-562: every capture below is `if ...; then rc=0; else rc=$?; fi`, and NONE is
# `|| true`. All of them feed check_rc, so the EXIT STATUS is the assertion —
# tolerating it would pass every refusal cell silently. I tried `|| true` on the
# first one, believing its assertion read only $out; cell (a) also reads $rc and
# went from pass to fail. The before/after cell count is what caught it. pipefail
