# Run a cargo test command and say whether a BUILD WAS IN FLIGHT while it ran.
#
# WHY (AMUX-3853). On 2026-08-28 a full `cargo test -p amux-server --lib` came
# back with 8 failures in `opencode::structured`, in code nobody had touched.
# Re-run in isolation: 15 pass, 0 fail. The failures were contention — those
# tests spawn a binary out of the shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR while the auto-builder
# is rewriting it, the ETXTBSY family `2618b7d3` already added a retry for. The
# retry is not enough under the load this box actually carries (the fleet, a
# builder rebuilding on every commit, and any peer running clippy).
#
# The cost is not the wasted run. It is that "1530 pass, 0 failed" and "8 failed"
# are both produced by the same command against the same code, and NOTHING in
# cargo's output says which kind of run you got. Every green suite here silently
# means "green, AND nothing was building" — the second clause is invisible, so
# nobody states it, and a red one gets read as a regression.
#
# The wrong lesson from that is "ignore red suites". This exists so you do not
# have to: it prints the missing clause beside the result.

# RUN FROM A SNAPSHOT OF THIS FILE (AF-368, found by `amux`).
#
# bash reads a script INCREMENTALLY, by byte offset, not into memory up front. On
# a shared checkout that makes every long-running .sh a moving target: a peer
# commits to it, the file grows underneath the running shell, the offsets shift,
# and bash resumes mid-token. It then fails on whatever byte now sits at its saved
# position, which is usually not where the edit was.
#
# Measured live 2026-08-31, and the surface is maximally misleading:
#
#   1888 passed, 0 failed, no `test result: FAILED` line anywhere
#   no contention verdict printed at all
#   ./scripts/test-contended.sh: line 53: syntax error near unexpected token `('
#   exit 2
#
# Line 53 was a bare `#`, and the file was `bash -n` clean the whole time. Two
# commits of mine landed inside that run. Every test had already passed. Anyone
# reading exit 2 reports a red suite; what caught it was that "0 failed" and
# "exit 2" cannot both be a test result.
#
# THIS IS THE THIRD CAUSE, after the builder and the dirty worktree, and it is the
# one this script structurally CANNOT report: it dies before reaching any echo, so
# its verdict is not wrong, it is absent. The instrument's blind spot is the
# instrument. Snapshotting is the only fix at the right layer — a report cannot
# describe a run that stopped existing.

# THE SECOND WAY A PEER REDDENS YOUR SUITE (AF-356).
#
# The builder is one of TWO causes and this wrapper only ever measured that one,
# so its clean verdict ("NOT build contention") read as "therefore your bug". The
# other cause is a peer's UNCOMMITTED SOURCE sitting in the shared worktree: cargo
# compiles the tree, not your commit, so their half-finished edit fails a test in a
# module you never opened, and it passes on a rerun after they finish. Identical
# symptom to ETXTBSY, and nothing distinguished them.
#
# Measured live 2026-08-31: `amux` ran the suite and got one failure in
# `gate_table_matches_python`, which they had not touched. They read this
# wrapper's clean verdict, concluded ETXTBSY, and carried that into a
# verification request as its stated weakest evidence line. The real cause was my
# uncommitted `ItemType::Decision` in the shared tree. Both of us were reasoning
# from an instrument that answered a narrower question than the sentence it printed.
#
# Captured BEFORE and AFTER, because a tree that CHANGED under the compile is the
# strongest form of the signal and a single snapshot cannot see it.
#
# Deliberately NOT attributed to a lane. Owner-by-mtime is the inference that has
# been wrong repeatedly on this checkout (AF-179, AMUX-3662, where a lane's own
# writes read as a phantom co-editor), and a confident wrong owner is worse than a
# named file with no owner. The file names are what a reader needs; they can tell

# ── WHICH TARGETS DID THIS NOT RUN? (AF-346) ────────────────────────────────
#
# `cargo test -p amux-server --lib` reports "1827 passed" and SKIPS every
# `tests/*.rs` target — 50 files here. That is not a footnote: the a99955f7
# dashboard regression was caught by a guard that ALREADY EXISTED, was correct,
# and would have blocked the commit. It did not run, because the author verified
# with `--lib` and read a four-digit pass count as the suite.
#
# The number is the trap. A run that says "1827 passed" and a run that says
# "1827 passed, and 50 integration targets were not built" are the same command
# with the same exit status, and only the second one lets you decide whether you
# care. This is the same rule the contention and worktree clauses below already
# follow: say what was NOT measured, in the same breath as the result.
#
# Counted from disk rather than from a constant, so a new integration file is
# included the day it lands rather than when someone remembers to bump a number.
# WHAT ELSE NARROWS A RUN (AF-346, second pass). The clause below starts at
# --lib because that is the flag that cost us a regression, and the entry's own
# closing sentence is that `--lib` is not the only such flag. Three more, each
# printing a number that reads like a total:
#
#   --test <name>   runs ONE integration target and skips the LIB ENTIRELY. On
#                   this crate that is the larger half by a wide margin, and the
#                   number it prints is the smallest of any selector here, so it
#                   is the one most likely to be read as a clean suite.
#   --tests/--benches/--examples  select a target KIND and skip the others.
#   a bare FILTER   (`-p amux-server --lib autofix`) runs only the tests whose
#                   name matches. cargo DOES print "N filtered out", which is
#                   why this one gets a shorter note: the denominator is already
#                   on screen, it is just easy to skim past when N is the number
#                   you came for.
#
# Read off the ARGUMENTS, not off cargo's output, so a run that dies before
# printing anything is still describable. That is the lesson of the snapshot
# block at the top of this file.
