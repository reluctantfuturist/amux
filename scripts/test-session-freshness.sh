# AEAB-18 — the SessionStart freshness hook must warn when THIS checkout has
# diverged, because an append to a shared append-only file here reaches nobody.
#
# The failure being guarded is silent and write-shaped. A merely-stale checkout
# announces itself the moment you pull. A DIVERGED one does not: appending to
# frustrations.md succeeds, prints nothing, and never reaches origin, because the
# hourly sync job refuses to fast-forward (correctly — it must not rewrite a
# shared tree). On 2026-08-17 four entries went in that way; that copy held 25
# entries while origin held 124, and it was noticed by chance days later.
#
# Every case builds REAL git repos and runs the SHIPPED hook as a subprocess, so
# this exercises the actual dispatch path rather than a paraphrase of its logic.
#
# The (a) and (c)/(d) cases are the load-bearing ones: a hook that warned
# unconditionally would satisfy (b) while being pure noise, and noise is how a
# banner gets ignored — which the hook's own header calls out as the reason it
# stays silent when everything is current.
