  # DISK GUARD (AMUX-2754). Runs BEFORE the worktree checkout below, because
  # that checkout writes 1000+ files — freeing space after consuming it is the
  # wrong order when the whole point is that the volume is nearly full. The shared target dir has no GC — cargo never
  # reclaims — so it grows without bound, and on 2026-08-10 the volume hit
  # 741MB free with a 50-session fleet and writes failing with ENOSPC.
  #
  # The trigger is FREE DISK, deliberately not target-dir size. Disk-full is
  # the thing that actually broke the fleet; dir size is a proxy for it whose
  # threshold would be a guess, and the same 28GB is fine on this volume and
  # fatal on a smaller one. Free space is the condition that is absent in the
  # healthy state, which is the signal worth tripping on.
  #
  # Clearing the cache costs one cold build (~3min, once). That is the cheap
  # side of this trade by a wide margin: the expensive side is every lane
  # failing to write.
  # CLEAR THE IDLE CACHE FIRST, AND THE ONE THIS BUILD NEEDS ONLY AS A LAST
  # RESORT. Until 2026-08-19 this deleted `rust-build-target` unconditionally —
  # the cache it was ABOUT TO FILL on the very next line — while
  # `rust-build-target-e2e-head` sat untouched beside it at 4.2GB. Measured that
  # day: the clear fired 16 times, free space still reached 1GB, and each pass
  # freed ~2GB that the immediately-following cold build put straight back. A
  # treadmill that burns a cold build every 60s and never relieves the pressure,
  # while four times as much reclaimable space sat one directory over.
  #
  # So: order by what this build does NOT need, re-measure between steps, and
  # stop as soon as the floor is cleared. `-e2e-head` belongs to e2e/serve-head.sh
  # and is regenerable; clearing it costs a cold e2e build the next time someone
  # runs e2e locally, which is far rarer than this 60s tick.
  # `df -Pk` / `du -sk`, NOT `df -g` / `du -sg`. The -g forms are BSD-only: GNU
  # coreutils rejects them with "df: invalid option -- 'g'", FREE_GB comes back
  # EMPTY, `${FREE_GB:-999}` substitutes 999, and the guard silently never fires.
  # A disk guard that is a no-op on Linux while reporting nothing is the shape
  # this repo keeps finding — it does not fail, it just quietly does not run.
  # Caught by scripts/test-build-disk-clear.sh on its first CI run; the Rust side
  # already had it right (storage::disk_free_bytes uses `df -Pk`), so this was
  # one convention drifting from another inside the same codebase.
  # TWO THRESHOLDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS (AEAB-35). The first cut of
  # this used one number for both and the keep-warm exit below became DEAD CODE:
  # it fired only once free space reached AMUX_BUILD_MIN_FREE_GB (25GB), on a
  # volume sitting at 4GB, so after reclaiming the idle cache the condition was
  # still false and the shared cache was destroyed anyway. Measured: zero
  # "reclaimed to" lines, ever. A stop condition above the achievable maximum is
  # not a stop condition — the mirror of "a threshold below the baseline is not a
  # detector", and it reads perfectly sensibly in review.
  #
  #   AMUX_BUILD_MIN_FREE_GB (25)             — is the FLEET at ENOSPC risk?
  #                                             Right number for that; AMUX-2754
  #                                             is 741MB free with lanes failing
  #                                             to write. It decides whether to
  #                                             reclaim AT ALL.
  #   AMUX_BUILD_SACRIFICE_CACHE_BELOW_GB (8) — can THIS BUILD proceed while
  #                                             keeping its cache? A cargo build
  #                                             plus a ~5GB target dir needs
  #                                             single-digit GB, not 25.
  #
  # Between the two, reclaim the idle caches and let the build stay warm. Below
  # the lower one, the shared cache genuinely is worth a cold build.
  # DEBUG ARTIFACT CLEANUP (2026-08-29). This script ONLY builds --release, but

    # that touches crates/: 743 times between 2026-08-09 and 08-23, ~53 a day.

    # allowing CANNOT stick until the identity is stable, which is this block.
