# AMUX-4705 — a piped brief is a TITLE AND A BODY, not one enormous title.
#
# THE DEFECT: `--stdin` and `--file` set the title, which is what their usage lines
# say and is exactly the trap. The thing a caller pipes into a card verb is the whole
# brief, and piping is the SANCTIONED way to pass text that must not be shell-evaluated
# (AMUX-1888), so following the documented advice produced a card whose title was a
# paragraph and whose description was empty.
#
# Measured 2026-09-15, two lanes inside one hour. mixpeek-finances hit it on all six
# requests they re-issued onto the new routing (TG-3756 pre-repair: title
# "Full scope, gates, evidence...", desc len 0) and repaired each by PATCH. amux hit it
# on AT-24, compounded by passing --stdin and --desc-stdin together, which both call
# `cat` so the second read nothing.
#
# Asserts the BYTES POSTED, against a loopback recorder, because the split happens in
# the CLI and no server test can see it.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.
