# AMUX-4653 — `amux board request <worker> <title>` must post `request_to`.
#
# THE DEFECT: it posted {"title": ..., "status": "backlog", "reviewer": "<worker>"}
# with no session, so the card landed on the SENDER's own board. Dispatch selects by
# session and the reviewer nudge fires only on review/done, so the named worker was
# never offered it. 88 such cards were sitting in senders' backlogs on 2026-09-15,
# ten of them mixpeek-finances' (MF-1160..1167, 1169, 1174), draining back into their
# own pickup as churn.
#
# The server half is covered by crates/amux-server/tests/board_request.rs. This cell
# covers the half that file cannot see: the BYTES THE CLI SENDS. A server that honours
# request_to and a CLI that still sends reviewer both pass their own tests while the
# feature is dead, which is exactly the shape that produced the original bug.
#
# It runs the real dispatch path against a throwaway HTTP recorder on loopback, so
# what is asserted is the actual request body, not a re-derivation of it.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.

# against paused amux-testing: the API named the refusal, `amux board review`
# printed one line, "AMUX-4707 -> review". Four real cards went to that same
# paused lane over five hours with nobody told.
#
# The recorder answers with the unreachable shape so this cell tests the CLI's
# handling of it, which is the half no server test can see.
