"""Find frustration signals in Ethan's own messages — deterministically.

Ethan, 2026-08-22: "make a sched that goes thru my messages and infers
frustration for example repetitive messages, frustration etc what ever you
think but make sure it has the ability to autofix amux shit that is identified
from messages."

WHAT THIS DOES AND DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
-------------------------------------------
It computes CANDIDATES and ranks them. It does not judge them, and it does not
call a model. Ethos rule 2: repetition is a string comparison and a marker is a
regex, so paying a model to find them would be spending judgment on arithmetic.
The judging — "is this actually frustration, and what amux defect is under it"
— is what the scheduled SESSION does with this output, and that is a real
judgment call worth a model.

Rule 5, the one that decides whether this is useful in six months: it must
DISCRIMINATE, not accumulate. A daily list of forty maybe-frustrated messages
is a log nobody reads. So every signal here is scored, the output is capped,
and a candidate has to clear a bar to appear at all. If a quiet day prints
nothing, that is the correct output and the scheduled session should say so.

THE SIGNALS, strongest first. Each is here because it means something specific:

  repeat-after-done   Ethan asked for something whose card is already done or
                      verified. The strongest signal in the file: it means a
                      fix shipped and did not reach him, which is a defect in
                      amux even when the code was right.
  near-duplicate      He said the same thing twice. Repetition is the clearest
                      frustration signal there is and it needs no interpreting.
  rapid-reprompt      A short imperative within 10 minutes of a previous
                      message to the same lane ("just do it now", "?", "well").
                      The shape of "you did not do what I asked".
  marker              Explicit language: still/again/why is/doesn't work/broken,
                      profanity, "??", "i said". Weakest on its own, which is
                      why it is scored lowest and never appears alone unless
                      it is strong.

WHY `type='user' AND origin=''`
-------------------------------
That is Ethan and nobody else. Peer relays are type='session' with origin set
to the sending lane; scheduler fires are type='schedule' with the schedule
title as origin. Measured 2026-08-22: 509 of his messages in 7 days against
4,061 lane relays, so getting this filter wrong would drown the signal in the
fleet talking to itself. `cmd_history.ts` is in MILLISECONDS.

# lookups on 2026-08-28 alone. That is the model doing arithmetic (ethos rule
# 2), and worse, it made the CHEAP question look as expensive as the one that
# genuinely cannot be answered, so both got the same shrug in the write-up.
#
# The verdict logic is AF-267's, and its three states matter: `cmd_history`
# alone CANNOT answer this. AMUX-3541 deliberately stopped stamping
# `delivered_at` for queued rows, so a NULL there means "nobody writes here",
# not "not delivered" -- one sweep read it the first way and was one step from
# filing 92 lost messages. `steering_history` is stamped by the deliverer and
# is the only thing that knows.
#
# The join is on SESSION and a +/-10s window around the timestamp, NEVER on
# text: cmd_history keeps the "[08:19 AM] " prefix the composer adds and
# steering_history does not, so a text match silently misses exactly the rows
