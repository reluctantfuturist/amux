# mac-cleanup-tick.sh — the scheduled machine-cleanup tick.
#
# WHAT IT ACTS ON, and it is a short list on purpose:
#   1. `purge`, when the kernel says the machine is under memory pressure or
#      free memory is under a floor. On 2026-09-15 at 10:00 one purge took free
#      memory from 3.6 GB to 14.0 GB. It drops caches; it cannot lose work.
#   2. A launchd agent named in AMUX_CLEANUP_AGENTS whose footprint has grown
#      past AMUX_CLEANUP_AGENT_LEAK_GB. The prompting case is
#      com.procwarden.menubar, which leaked to 27 GB over 15 days and again to
#      1.3 GB within 13 hours of a restart. KeepAlive brings it straight back,
#      so a restart costs nothing but the leak.
#
# WHAT IT ONLY REPORTS, however large it gets:
#   Everything else. fseventsd held 96 GB on this box and macOS protects it; a
#   peer lane's colima VM held 16 GB plus 31 GB compressed and that lane was
#   using it; Chrome and Docker are the human's. Killing another party's work to
#   reclaim memory is a decision for its owner (ethos rule 8), so this names the
#   consumer, its owner and the remedy, and stops there.
#
# WHY sudo appears at all: on this box passwordless sudo is limited to
# /usr/sbin/purge and /usr/bin/mdutil. `purge` is therefore the ONE reclaim this
# script can perform as root, and a reboot (the only remedy for fseventsd) needs
# a password nobody can type for it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mac-cleanup-tick.sh             # measure, act where warranted
#   scripts/mac-cleanup-tick.sh --dry-run   # measure, act on nothing
set -uo pipefail

# launchd's PATH has no /usr/sbin, and sysctl/purge/vm_stat live there. Its
# sibling mac-pressure-tripwire.sh reported measured=false for exactly this
# reason (AMUX-4661), so this one exports the PATH before any probe runs.
