# Which commits has the auto-builder never actually built? (AMUX-3797)
#
# The builder builds `rev-parse HEAD` at each wakeup. On this checkout lanes
# land work a minute apart, so several commits accumulate between wakeups and
# only the LAST is ever compiled. The ones in between are never built as
# committed — they are built only as part of a later tree that already contains
# their successor's fixes.
#
# That is invisible today. `~/.amux/rust-build-provenance.json` holds the LAST
# successful build and nothing else, and the log reads like throughput. So
# "this sha was never compiled" is a fact the box already has and nobody asks.
#
# ONLY RUST-TOUCHING COMMITS COUNT, and getting this wrong inflates the answer
# badly. rust-auto-build.sh:46 triggers on
# `git log -1 --format=%H -- crates/ Cargo.toml Cargo.lock`, so a docs or
# markdown commit is CORRECTLY never a build target and must not be reported as
# a miss. Counting every commit in the range gave 83 of 235 here; over the
# builder's whole life the same mistake reads 706 of 1574 against a true 161 of
# 1028 (amux-frustrations measured both). The range filter below is what keeps
# this honest.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-27 across the builder's life (7253465c onward): 161 of 1028
# Rust-touching commits on main — 16% — were never a `building` target. Those
# are the set that would go red on whoever's PR happens to include them, and the
# set a bisect breaks on.
#
# A `SKIP` LINE IS NOT A MISS. It is the dedupe declining a second trigger for a
# sha a running build already has: 287 shas were SKIPped at least once and only
# 7 were never subsequently built. Reading SKIP as "never built" counts the
# dedupe as a loss — the mistake this card was first filed on.
#
# NOT A GATE. It reports; it does not refuse. Building every commit was measured
# at ~15-22s against a fleet that lands them far faster, so serialising a build
# per commit would make the builder the bottleneck it currently avoids. The cost
# objection is real; the SILENCE is what was not defensible.
