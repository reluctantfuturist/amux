# AEAB-36 — a board write that never reached the server must SAY SO, and must
# never be confused with a write the server refused.
#
# The bug: `set -euo pipefail` (amux line 19) turned a transport failure into a
# silent abort. The outcome write is `curl | python3` whose python deliberately
# exits 0 so a lost outcome does not block the transition — `pipefail` returned
# curl's status instead, and `set -e` killed the script right there, AFTER the
# warning had printed. The transition write was worse: not piped at all, so
# `result=$(_board_transition ...)` aborted the caller and `amux board done <ID>`
# printed ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and exited 7.
#
# Observed live 2026-08-19 closing AEAB-34 while the server was restarting to
# adopt a build: one warning naming only the outcome, status silently unchanged.
# The natural reading — "status moved, prose lost" — was the exact opposite of
# what happened.
#
# ISOLATION: every case points AMUX_API and AMUX_URL at a dead port or a local
# stub. An earlier suite in this repo exported the wrong variable, reached the
# LIVE board and filed three junk cards while reporting green.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure. Wired into .github/workflows/checks.yml.
