"""Move a VALIDATED frustrations.md entry into frustrations-archive.md.

Ethan, 2026-08-24: "its only verified when the originating session validates and
agrees its complete. once its complete delete from this md."

Deleting is the instruction; this is where the bytes go, and it exists because
`.claude/rules/frustrations.md` records what happens without it. A set-difference
over one file cannot see a MOVE and reports it as a deletion every time --
creative-dna measured 15 of 15 "lost" entries as archive moves, with the
restore/remove cycle run three times before anyone noticed. So the archive is not
sentiment: it is the thing that makes "was this lost or was it finished?"
answerable by a grep instead of by reading git history.

Every archived entry names the actual verifier and evidence. Ethan's 2026-09-11
RETIRE ON EVIDENCE decision (AF-352) permits independent verification of objective
claims from gone or isolated authors. Subjective claims still need their author;
board status alone is never evidence. This supersedes the original author-only
rule quoted above. See `.claude/rules/frustrations.md` for the complete protocol.

Usage:
    scripts/frustrations-archive.py <line> <validated-by> <evidence...>
    scripts/frustrations-archive.py <line> <who> --superseded --evidence-stdin

`--superseded` is the THIRD disposition, for an entry whose MECHANISM was wrong
and which a later entry corrects. It stamps SUPERSEDED: instead of VALIDATED:,
because archiving a wrong entry as validated files a false mechanism as history
(AF-243).
    scripts/frustrations-archive.py <line> <validated-by> --evidence-stdin
    scripts/frustrations-archive.py <line> <validated-by> --evidence-file <path>

PREFER --evidence-stdin/--evidence-file whenever the evidence quotes code.
Inline text is evaluated by YOUR shell first, so backticks and $(...) in it are
EXECUTED before this script sees them (AMUX-1888).

Entries retired from [`frustrations.md`](frustrations.md). The originating session
validates the claim, or an independent verifier checks an objective claim from a
gone/isolated author under Ethan’s AF-352 decision (2026-09-11). `VALIDATED:` names
the actual verifier and evidence; `SUPERSEDED:` preserves a disproven mechanism.
Subjective claims remain open without their author’s validation.

This file exists so that "was this entry lost, or was it finished?" is a grep rather
than an archaeology exercise. A set-difference over the ledger alone cannot see a
MOVE and reports it as a deletion every time. Before restoring anything that looks
missing from `frustrations.md`, grep here first: present means it was retired on
purpose, and re-appending it manufactures a duplicate.

Nothing here is live. `frustrations.md` is the live file and the invariants
`frustrations.ledger_agrees_with_board` / `frustrations.cards_are_reachable` read
only that one.

def field(block, key):
    """One `KEY:` field out of an entry block, continuation lines included.

    THE TERMINATOR ACCEPTS A HYPHEN, and it must (AF-264). It used to be
    `[A-Z_]+:`, so a field whose NAME contained a hyphen was not recognised as
    the start of the next field — and because the body pattern is non-greedy and
    needs the lookahead to stop, the match failed entirely and the field BEFORE
    it came back EMPTY.

    Measured the day it was written: an entry carrying `CARD: AF-242` followed by
    a `NOTE-CARD:` line reported "no CARD field", so the entry was archived with
    its symptom never reaching the card — the AF-38 guarantee that AF-239 exists
    to keep, silently unmet by a field name.

    The failure is one field UPSTREAM of the cause, which is what makes it worth
    a comment: nothing about reading the `NOTE-CARD:` line suggests it could
    blank `CARD:` above it, and the tool's only symptom was a correct-sounding
    "no CARD field".

    THE CONTINUATION IS LINE-SHAPED AND ACCEPTS ANY INDENT (AF-387). It used to
    be `((?:.|\n  )+?)` with a lookahead terminator: one alternation branch for
    ordinary characters and one for the literal two-space newline. `.` does not
    cross a newline without re.S, so an entry indenting its continuations by ONE
    space could not extend the group past its first line, the lookahead then had
    to match a line starting with a space, it did not, and the whole match
    failed. Same symptom as above, one width over: the tool said "entry has no
    SYMPTOM/COST to carry" about an entry that had both.

    Widening that alternation to `\n[ \t]+` fixed the reading and introduced a
    worse bug: two branches that can both consume the same text, under a `+?`,
    with a lookahead that fails, is catastrophic backtracking. It hung for over
    two minutes on the real ledger before it was killed, where the two-space form
    had been fast only because its second branch almost never matched.

    So the shape changed rather than the width. `(.*(?:\n[ \t]+.*)*)` is a first
    line plus any number of indented lines, each alternative anchored to a
    different position, no lookahead, no ambiguity. It needs no terminator
    because the next field and the next `## ` both start at column zero, which is
    the property the format already guarantees. Same 65 entries: 0.00s.

    Measured when this was written: 5 of 65 live entries and 2 of 98 archived
    ones were unreadable this way. The two archived ones had already been retired
    with their symptom and cost never reaching their cards, so the AF-38
    guarantee was quietly unmet on those moves exactly as AF-264 found it unmet
    on every move before it.

    Worth stating as a rule rather than a third patch: a hand-written indent
    width is a guess about how somebody else formats prose, and every wrong guess
    fails silently in the direction of "the field is not there".
