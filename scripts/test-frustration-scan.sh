# WHY THIS EXISTS. The detector fired on `gap < 60s AND similarity > 0.98` with no
# session check, so ONE INSTRUCTION FANNED TO TWO LANES read as a delivery defect.
# Measured on the real store 2026-08-23: ids 31157/31158, identical text 12s apart,
# to nissan and autodesk. The finding text told the reader "this is a DELIVERY
# defect, not frustration: check send_dedup" — a confident wrong answer about a bug
# that does not exist, which is worse than silence because it is actionable and the
# action is wasted.
#
# The cells run the SHIPPED scanner against a synthetic store via AMUX_DB, rather
# than restating its logic: simulating what you believe a classifier does cannot
# catch it doing something else.
#
# Cell B is the one that stops the "fix" being a hollowing-out: a scanner that
# classified NOTHING as double-delivery would pass cell A perfectly.
