"""Fleet-wide THEMATIC friction scan, across amux AND Mixpeek, deterministically.

Ethan, 2026-08-29 (MSG-35488): "look for opportunities that are thematic such
that we can bake them into our system prompt ... look for areas where we've
historically continually hit roadblocks or repeated snags. It might not be the
exact same problem every time but a thematic problem, like we always forget to
add permissions to the right place or we always forget to do integration tests."
Then, 2026-08-30: "it should span not just amux though but also Mixpeek."

WHAT THIS IS, AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM ITS TWO NEIGHBOURS
--------------------------------------------------------
`frustration_scan.py` asks, of ONE message: is Ethan frustrated here, and is
there an amux defect under it. The unit is a message and the fix is a defect.

This script asks, of MANY days and BOTH repos: which CLASS of friction keeps
coming back, and which PROMPT, RULE or MECHANISM should absorb it so it stops.
The unit is a class and the fix is usually a sentence in a CLAUDE.md, a hook, or
a gate, rather than a code change. A class that appears in both repos is harness-level and
belongs in the global prompt; a class in one repo belongs in that repo's file.
That split IS the answer to "should this go in the system prompt", so the script
computes it rather than leaving the session to eyeball it.

It computes signals. It does not name themes and it does not call a model
(ethos rule 2). Naming what a cluster MEANS, and deciding which file absorbs it,
is the judgment the scheduled session is for.

RULE 5: IT MUST DISCRIMINATE, NOT ACCUMULATE
---------------------------------------------
A daily report of every signal is a log nobody reads, and this file would then
be the thing it is complaining about. So every signal is compared against its
own trailing baseline and only ACTIVE ones print: a signal is active when it is
materially above its own trailing rate, or when it is a standing structural
count over its threshold. A quiet day printing three lines is the correct
output.

RULE 4: SAY WHETHER THE PROBE RAN
----------------------------------
Every signal carries `measured` and `n_considered`. A source that could not be
read (mixpeek checkout absent, DB locked) reports measured=false with a reason,
never a zero. A zero from an unread source is the exact failure this fleet has
41 frustration entries about.

# RULE CLASSES: the heart of the "bake it into the system prompt" question.
#
# Each class is a standing rule the fleet is supposed to already follow. The
# signal is not "Ethan said this once", it is "Ethan had to say it AGAIN, and
# the rule is ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN". A restated rule that is already in prose is
# evidence the prose is not the enforcement point, which is the single pattern
# under 9 of the 10 themes in the 2026-08-29 review.
#
# `doc_probe` is what we grep the CLAUDE.md files for to decide "already
# written". If a class is restated and the probe MISSES, the fix is cheap: write
# it. If it is restated and the probe HITS, prose already failed and the fix is a
# mechanism. The two verdicts want completely different work, which is why this
# is computed and not guessed.

#
# THE DEFECT. AREA_CANON is first-match-wins over the whole title, and a Mixpeek
# title leads with its subsystem, so "Engine/batches (a batch reports COMPLETED,
# 100%, failed_objects [] and writes ZERO documents)" is `engine`. The theme this
# belongs to is "Instruments that lie", whose signal is
# `ledger-cluster:instruments`, and that signal read QUIET on 2026-09-01 while
# three fresh instances of the class sat in the same scan output.
#
# MEASURED, and it corrects the card that filed this: reordering AREA_CANON would
# have fixed NOTHING. 16 open entries across both ledgers describe this shape and
# only 3 of them contain any word from the instruments arm
# (instrument|measur|probe|metric|observab|log). The failure is vocabulary, not
# ordering. Those 16 are scattered over NINE clusters: api-contract, deploy-ci,
# engine, ui, board-gates, cli, instruments.
#
# WHY THIS IS AN EXTRA LABEL AND NOT A REORDER OR A FULL MULTI-LABEL CANON. Both
# alternatives were measured before being rejected. Reordering steals entries from
# the subsystem clusters, which moves the trailing baselines the sweep compares
# against. Letting every AREA_CANON arm apply independently is worse: the patterns
# were written for first-match-wins and are far too loose to stand alone. Measured
# over the same 1131 entries it gives 2.08 labels each, with `doc` matching every
# entry that says "documents" (8 -> 156) and `index|cluster|pipeline` inflating
# engine 134 -> 472. So this adds ONE precise membership and takes nothing away:
# instruments 103 -> 116, every other cluster unchanged.
# WIDENED 2026-09-04, and the widening is the sweep's own finding. The arms above
# were written from three specimens that all said "reports COMPLETED", so the
# membership matched the WORDING of those three rather than the class. Measured
# over the same 1206 open entries: the shipped arms caught 32, and 63 more open
# entries describe the identical shape in different words. Sampled at 4 per arm,
# every one is the class: "documents/list through the SHARED host returns a silent
# 200-empty", "`objects/batch` silently drops any blob whose URL its fetcher cannot
# reach", "setting an App `is_active: false` does NOT take it offline",
# "`post_filters` is typed, documented, autocompleted, and never applied".
#
# THE BASELINE MOVES AND THE NEXT RUN MUST NOT READ IT AS A SURGE. instruments
# goes 32 -> 95 memberships on the same corpus, with no entry leaving its
# subsystem cluster. That is an instrument change, not new friction, and it is
# recorded in docs/friction-themes.md against the theme it feeds.
#
# EACH ARM IS ITS OWN PHRASE, not a general "success" pattern. A bare \bok\b or
# \bgreen\b was measured and rejected: they match ordinary prose and would let

    a DESCRIPTION of the numbers rather than a filter that hides anything.

    `pairs` is [(session, ts_ms)] over EVERY matching row, never the displayed
    sample — the evidence list truncates at MAX_PER_SIGNAL, so computing this
    from it would measure the truncation.
