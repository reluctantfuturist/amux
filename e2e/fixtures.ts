/**
 * The e2e `test` every spec should import: page.route stubs that never match
 * are reported instead of passing silently (AF-47).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, measured 2026-08-13. `system-jobs.spec.ts` stubbed
 * `/api/system-jobs` with `page.route` and a registered service worker defeated
 * it — the request went through the worker's fetch handler, where `page.route`
 * cannot see it. The stub did not error. The page rendered the REAL job list,
 * the spec diffed that against the stubbed shape, and the failure read as "the
 * stalled-row styling is broken under WebKit". The natural next move is to go
 * read the CSS, and that is where the hour went.
 *
 * The service-worker half is fixed: playwright.config.ts sets
 * `serviceWorkers: 'block'` as the default, opt-OUT. This file fixes the other
 * half, which is the general one — NOTHING tells you a stub matched zero
 * requests. A stub that never fires is almost always a bug, and today it is
 * indistinguishable from one that fired: same green-looking machinery, no
 * output either way. A service worker is only one of the ways to get there; a
 * pattern with the wrong glob, a path that changed, a request the app stopped
 * making, and a route registered after the request all produce the identical
 * silence and the identical confident-but-wrong failure about rendering.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. Every page.route is wrapped so every registered stub counts its
 * hits, and at teardown a stub with zero hits fails the test with a message
 * that names the stub — so the next occurrence says "this stub never matched,
 * you tested the REAL endpoint" rather than blaming the renderer.
 *
 * IT IS SILENT WHEN THE TEST ALREADY FAILED. An unhit stub is a common
 * DOWNSTREAM symptom of a test that died before it got to the interaction, and
 * reporting it there would be this entry's own defect committed by its own fix:
 * a confident message pointing at the wrong subsystem. The real error wins.
 *
 * OPTING OUT. A stub that legitimately may not fire — a defensive one for a
 * branch that does not always run — declares itself:
 *
 *     await page.route('**\/api/thing', handler);
 *     allowUnusedRoute(page, '**\/api/thing');   // and say WHY on this line
 *
 * The declaration is the point. "May not fire" is a claim about the app, and
 * writing it down is what stops the guard from being switched off wholesale.
